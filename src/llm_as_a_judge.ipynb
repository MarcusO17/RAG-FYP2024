      "    system_answer: Yes, deadlifting can make your joints sore, especially if you're new to the exercise or have poor form. The movement requires engagement of multiple muscle groups, including the glutes, hamstrings, lower back, adductors, and core, which can cause soreness in these areas. Additionally, tight hamstrings or poor execution can lead to biomechanical errors that may cause low back pain or injury. However, with proper form and progressive overload, deadlifting can actually help strengthen your joints and reduce the risk of injury.\n",
