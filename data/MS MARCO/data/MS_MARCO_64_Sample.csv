"who introduced modern methods of surgery, such as antiseptics, sterilization, and washing hands? brainly","[""The widespread introduction of antiseptic surgical methods followed the publishing of the paper Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery in 1867 by Joseph Lister, inspired by Louis Pasteur 's germ theory of putrefaction.""
 'Antiseptics are the substances that kill or prevent the growth of the microorganisms. The name comes from the Greek words anti (against) and sepsis (decay). Antiseptics prevent infection and other changes in living tissue by destroying or slowing the growth of germs (microorganisms that cause disease). The nature and use of anti-septics was not fully understood until the discovery of bacteria.'
 'Lister began washing his hands before operating, and wearing clean clothes. (Others such as Florence Nightingale, the pioneer of modern nursing, had already found that increased cleanliness reduced the death rate from infection among hospital patients.'
 ""1 Iodine is usually used in an alcohol solution (called tincture of iodine) or as Lugol's iodine solution as a pre-and postoperative antiseptic. 2  Some people do not recommend disinfecting minor wounds with iodine because of concern that it may induce scar tissue formation and increase healing time.""
 'None of these antiseptics, however, was sufficient to prevent the almost certain infection of wounds, particularly following surgery. Amputations, for example, were common in the 1800s, especially in the case of compound fracture (bone breaks that injure surrounding soft tissue).'
 'Even sterilization may not destroy prions. Some antiseptics are true germicides, capable of destroying microbes (bacteriocidal), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. Antibacterials are antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria.'
 ""Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to be transported through the lymphatic system to destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.""
 ""Genevieve Charlotte d'Arconville introduced the use of chloride of mercury as an antiseptic in 1766. After Bernard Courtois (1777-1838) discovered iodine in 1811, it became a popular antiseptic treatment for wounds.""
 '1 It is used as a scrub for preoperative hand cleansing, and in the form of a powder as an antiseptic baby powder, where it is dusted onto the navel as it heals. 2  Also used in mouthwashes and throat lozenges, it has a painkilling effect, as well as an antiseptic one. 3  Example: TCP.'
 'Lister’s early life. Joseph Lister was born in Upton, Essex, England, on April 5, 1827. He was the second of three children born to Joseph Jackson Lister, a very successful wine merchant and amateur scientist. Joseph Jackson Lister’s design of a microscope lens which did not distort colours opened the way for the microscope to be used as a serious scientific tool.']",Joseph Lister

can ativan be used for insomnia,"['Your doctor may prescribe lorazepam to be taken 2 to 3 times a day for conditions such as anxiety, or once daily for conditions such as insomnia. When you first start lorazepam, your doctor may slowly increase your dose to avoid side effects.'
 'It is most widely used for epilepsy, insomnia as well as anxiety. It is a highly addictive Benzodiazepine, which is otherwise known as “benzos.” Ativan requires a prescription from a doctor and typically recommended for short-term usage. Ativan is the brand name of the drug while the generic name is Lorazepam.'
 'In many cases, it is unclear if chronic insomnia is a symptom of some physical or psychological condition or if it is a primary disorder of its own. In most instances, a mix of psychological and physical conditions causes the insomnia.'
 ""A: Ativan (lorazepam) is a benzodiazepine drug that acts as an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety drug), amnesic, sedative/hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant. It's used for the short-term treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures, and sedation of hospitalized or aggressive patients.""
 'Insomnia can be a short-term or chronic condition, but it always involves problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Short-term (transient) insomnia can be caused by illness, stress, travel, or environmental factors. Long-term (chronic) insomnia may be due to underlying psychological or physical conditions.'
 'Lorazepam is also used to treat insomnia, epilepsy, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), agitation caused by alcohol withdrawal, and nausea and vomiting from cancer treatments. The drug belongs to a class of medications called benzodiazepines, and is available as oral tablets, an oral concentrate solution, and an injection.'
 'Insomnia can be a major problem during the transition to menopause (perimenopause), when hormones are fluctuating intensely. Insomnia during this period may be due to several different factors. In some women, hot flashes, sweating, and a sense of anxiety can disrupt sleep and cause sudden and frequent awakening.'
 ""Actigraphy may be used in some situations to help give a doctor a better picture of the patient's sleep pattern. It cannot, however, determine the severity of sleep problems. Most patients with insomnia are diagnosed and treated without this test. However, actigraphy may help identify insomnia in some patients.""
 ""Benzodiazepines, when used long-term, can promote drug tolerance or dependence, withdrawal syndromes, and cognitive damage. Withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and insomnia to seizures and psychosis. Lorazepam's side effects include amnesia, depression, excitement, or worsening of seizures.""
 'Lorazepam may be habit-forming, so do not take higher doses of the medication or use it for a longer time than your doctor recommends. Some people develop a tolerance to lorazepam, which makes the medication less effective. Use caution getting out of bed and walking within 8 hours of getting a lorazepam injection.']",Yes

what is the difference between conductivity and resistivity,"['Popular Answers. 1  Yes, there is a relation between the pH and the electrical current flow [the conductivity] of a solution, but there are other factors that affect the conductivity.

 'Thermal conductance is the time rate of steady state heat flow through a unit area of a material or construction induced by a unit temperature difference between the body surfaces, in W/m2⋅K. C-value, hence, is the reciprocal of the R-value and can be expressed as Equation (3).'
 ""Resistivity and conductivity are reciprocals: ρ = 1 / σ {\\displaystyle \\rho =1/\\sigma } . Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current. This formula is not exact, as it assumes the current density is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations.""
 'R-value – Thermal Resistance. Thermal resistance is the temperature difference, at steady state, between two defined surfaces of a material or construction that induces a unit heat flow rate through a unit area, K⋅m2/W. According to this definition and Equation 1, Equation 2, therefore, can be obtained.'
 'The higher the conductance the better the component is at conducting. Conductance is just the inverse of resistance.

what is a palliative consult,"['For the journal, see Palliative Medicine (journal). Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis.'
 'A. Palliative medicine is a medical subspecialty provided by doctors who offer palliative care for people who are seriously ill. Palliative care relieves suffering and improves quality of life for people of any age and at any stage in a serious illness, whether that illness is curable, chronic, or life-threatening.'
 'What is Palliative Care? Pathways’ Palliative Care Program is a specialized service providing pain and symptom management, counseling, support and guidance in navigating health care options and choices. This is not hospice care; it is an entirely different option for those dealing with serious illness.'
 'Palliative Care. The differences between hospice and palliative care. Hospice care and palliative care are very similar when it comes to the most important issue for dying people: care. Most people have heard of hospice care and have a general idea of what services hospice provides.'
 ""Q. What's the difference between palliative care and hospice care? A. Palliative care is whole-person care that relieves symptoms of a disease or disorder, whether or not it can be cured. Hospice is a specific type of palliative care for people who likely have 6 months or less to live. In other words, hospice care is always palliative, but not all palliative care is hospice care.""
 'An overview of the domains of the comprehensive palliative care assessment, and a number of related topics in medical consultation and palliative care are covered elsewhere. When patients and families facing a serious and/or life-threatening illness are asked what matters most to them, comfort is a foremost concern.'
 'Palliative Care Program. Palliative care helps patients with serious illness live as well and fully as possible. It can help at all stages of illness and be provided along with other treatments. Palliative care helps treat pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and other physical symptoms. Palliative care also provides emotional and spiritual support to patients and families, and helps them make decisions and coordinate care.'
 'Diane MF Savarese, MD. The clinical interview in palliative care is not only central to the information gathering process – to understanding and being able to address patient and family suffering – but is also a fundamental therapeutic method.'
 ""Palliative care is treatment of the discomfort, symptoms, and stress of serious illness. It can also help you deal with the side effects of the medical treatments you're receiving. Hospice care, care at the end of life, always includes palliative care. But you may receive palliative care at any stage of an illness. The goal is to make you comfortable and improve your quality of life.""

what is the survival rate for ovarian cancer,"['2 What is the survival rate for someone with stage 4 ovarian cancer that has spread to the brain, when she is 84? Unfortunately, low: Stage IV ovarian cancer unfortunately has a very low survival rate. The five year survival rate for this stage is around 11%.'
 'Prognosis and survival depend on many factors. Only a doctor familiar with a person’s medical history, type of cancer, stage, characteristics of the cancer, treatments chosen and response to treatment can put all of this information together with survival statistics to arrive at a prognosis.'
 'Ovarian cancer found in the abdomen and pelvis that is completely removed, with no cancer cells present in the margins around the tumour, has a more favourable prognosis. The more cancer that is removed with surgery, the better the prognosis. Some types of ovarian cancer have a more favourable prognosis.'
 'If you have questions about the ovarian cancer survival rate and how it applies to your individual circumstances, you can consult with a physician at Moffitt without a referral. Please contact us at 1-888-MOFFITT or complete our online form to schedule an appointment. About Moffitt.'
 'Dr. John Geisler Dr. Geisler. 1 doctor agreed: Ovarian cancer: The survival rate for completely staged, completely cytoreduced, treated with chemotherapy after surgery stage ii disease is >80% at 5 years. Without all of those qualifications, it is about 65% at five years.'
 'A prognosis is the doctor’s best estimate of how cancer will affect a person and how it will respond to treatment. A prognostic factor is an aspect of the cancer or a characteristic of the person that the doctor will consider when making a prognosis.'
 'Women who are diagnosed with early stage ovarian cancer (stages I to II) have five-year survival rates that range from 57% to 90%. In contrast, the five-year survival rates for patients who are diagnosed with advanced stage disease range from 18% to 45%. Despite advances in surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy the mortality rates of individuals with ovarian cancer remain poor. In the past 40 years, the median five-year survival rate for women with advanced stage cancer has increased from 37% to 46%.'
 '1 What is the survival rate for stage II low grade ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer: The survival rate for completely staged, completely cytoreduced, treated with chemotherapy after surgery stage ii disease is >80% at 5 years. Without all of those qualifications, it is about 65% at five years.'
 'About 75% of women with ovarian cancer survive one year after diagnosis, and 46% survive five years after being diagnosed. The survival rate drops as the stage of the cancer increases, with an 18% five-year survival rate in women whose cancer has spread beyond the abdomen. Younger women (under age 65) have a better five-year survival rate than older women.'
 'Furthermore, no patient can be considered “average,” and it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen in any individual case. The survival rate for ovarian cancer is usually expressed in terms of median survival, which refers to the length of time that half of the patients in a large group will survive. Thus, it naturally follows that many patients experience much better outcomes than the median suggests.']",57% to 90%

what does ear wax color mean,"[""1 doctor shared a insight. Ear wax in the ear canal is a mixture of secretions from oil and sweat glands in the canal's skin. Shedded skin cells are also a major ingredient of ear wax. There are two genetically determined types of ear wax: the wet type and the dry type.""
 'Unless you have an earwax blockage, you should leave your earwax alone; it will naturally migrate out of your ear. Trying to remove earwax with cotton swabs, ear candling, or other devices can cause earwax to move further into your ear canal and may damage your ear.'
 'In fact, if you have too little earwax in your ear canal, your ears may feel dry and itchy. This is because earwax is there for a reason – to protect your ears and provide lubrication. It does this by: Preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs from entering and damaging your ear.'
 'This accumulation of earwax may cause your ear canal to become blocked, leading to the following symptoms: 1  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged. 2  Partial (reversible) hearing loss, which may be progressive. 3  Tinnitus, ring, or noises in the ear.  Itching, odor, or 1  discharge. Coughing.'
 ""What is earwax? Earwax (also called cerumen) is made by glands in the outer part of the ear canal. Earwax helps your ear stay healthy.

 'What Affects the Color of Earwax. Earwax, also known as cerumen, is produced by glands in the skin of the outer ear. Earwax protects the ear from damage and infections and acts as a water repellent. It naturally ranges in color from yellow and orange to brown.'

 ""Here's how olive oil and canola oil compare. Olive Oil and Canola Oil are Manufactured Differently. Olive oil is made from olives, the fruit of the olive tree, and is considered a fruit oil. Ripe olives are crushed, then pressed; the collected juices constitute olive oil.""
 'Misinformation about canola oil may stem from the fact that the canola plant was developed through crossbreeding with the rapeseed plant. Rapeseed oil contains very high levels of erucic acid, a compound that in large amounts can be toxic to humans. Canola oil, however, contains very low levels of erucic acid. Canola oil is also low in saturated fat and has a high proportion of monounsaturated fat, which makes it a healthy and safe choice when it comes to cooking oils. With.

 ""Don't be fooled......Canola Oil is in everything!!! Always read the ingredients of every product you buy, anywhere!!! Even in the Health Food Stores, Canola Oil is widely used in their products.""
 ""While olive oil is considered the healthier oil, it's sometimes appropriate to choose canola oil instead. Extra virgin and virgin olive oils retain much of the flavor of the olives from which they're pressed, so while they might make a tasty dip or dressing, they often aren't appropriate for cooking or baking.""

what is mass multiplied by acceleration,"['In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.'
 'Best Answer: Gravity is the force by which one mass attracts another, and vice-versa. Even though an object is at rest and motionless, there is a gravitational force acting upon it. Without that gravitational force, the object would essentially start floating around.'
 'Get free help! 1  80% of questions are answered in under 10 minutes. 2  Answers come with explanations, so that you can learn. 3  Answer quality is ensured by our experts.'
 'A way to think about force is using the equation you stated. Force = Mass x Acceleration. Using some standard units, 1 unit of Force called a Newton is the amount it takes to accelerate an object having a mass of 1 kg exactly 1 m/s^2 (assuming no friction). 1 Newton = 1 kg x 1 m/s^2.'
 ""Now the units of force per mass are also those of acceleration. And it so happens that because gravitational mass (the thing that feels gravity) is equivalent to inertial mass (the m in Newton's second law that resists acceleration), the m's cancel if gravity is the only force acting. F = ma = mg, so a=g.""

An object with a mass of 100 grams (0.100 kg) is dropped from a certain height and has a velocity of 60 meters/second.'
 'Mass and Weight. The mass of an object is a fundamental property of the object; a numerical measure of its inertia; a fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object. Definitions of mass often seem circular because it is such a fundamental quantity that it is hard to define in terms of something else.'
 'The weight of an object is the force of gravity on the object and may be defined as the mass times the acceleration of gravity, w = mg. Since the weight is a force, its SI unit is the newton. Density is mass/volume.'
 'Now, to calculate the force of the object on the earth, and the force imparted by the earth on that object, take the equation F = (G me m2) / (r^2) where G is the universal gravitational constant, me is the mass of the earth, m2 is the mass of your object, and r^2 is radius of the earth, squared.'

can deadlifting make your joints sore,"[""Because of the mechanics of the movement, the deadlift is considered to be a safe exercise for the knee. But everyone is built differently, with different proportions and biomechanics, and it's possible for deadlifts to cause knee pain. If you suffer from chronic or sharp knee pain, be sure to talk to your doctor.""
 'Now keep in mind, too, that simply arching hard can cause a lot of soreness in the lower back. For example I know when I used to arch really hard when bench pressing my back was more sore after a heavy bench workout than a heavy deadlift workout!'

 ""Deadlifts: A Sore Knee Solution. Rather than being the cause of your knee pain, deadlifts could actually help to strengthen your knees and help ease said pain. By strengthening your posterior chain muscles -- the glutes, lower back and hamstrings -- you'll actually reduce your risk of injury, according to Robertson.""
 'When done correctly, deadlifts are an effective exercise to improve functional hamstring strength and definition. But tight hamstrings can cause you to make key biomechanical errors in execution that can lead to low back pain or injury.'
 'A reason your knees may be getting sore from deadlifts is because your form is not quite right. If your knees drift too far forward when deadlifting, this turns the exercise into more of a knee-dominant one, notes strength coach Mike Robertson.'
 'The stance you use can play a role in how sore your glutes get. A sumo stance, which involves a very wide foot spacing, with your hands and arms inside your thighs, places more stress on your glutes than the conventional narrower width stance, according to coach Mike Robertson of Robertson Training Systems.'
 'Your hamstrings are responsible for knee flexion and work with the gluteal muscles to extend the hip. When your hamstring muscles and tendons are tight, they affect both the knee and hip joints.

These conditions recrystallize the sand grains and the silica cement that binds them together.t is often difficult or impossible to differentiate quartz arenite from quartzite. The transition of sandstone into quartzite is a gradual process.

 'If that is the case, you will have to wait for more than 6 months if you want to apply again during the next fall semester. In order to avoid that, you can try and apply in the fall season itself, so you can later bank on the spring intake.'
 'But then, it is easier to graduate in three semesters if you apply for the fall intake, since in that case, you will finish off your course by the next spring semester, and you will still have a few months of time before campus recruiting begins.'
 'Acceptance rates are usually university specific, and generally do not depend on which semester you are applying in. But then, you should remember the fact that since the class sizes are much larger for the fall intake, you will have a much better chance of getting admitted than if you apply for the spring season.'
 'Colleges terms can be separated by quarters (typically 10 weeks) or by semesters (typically 17-18 weeks). Summer classes can be between 3 and 11 weeks, depending on the colleg…e and the subject. Semesters are about 4 months in duration. The fall semester is from late August or early September to December; the spring semester is usually from January to late April or early May.'
 'What to know about starting college in the spring semester. Most college freshmen begin their classes in the fall semester that immediately follows their high school graduation.
