 'Normal blood pressure is below 120/80, blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89 is pre-hypertension and blood pressure 140/90 or above is considered hypertension. An elevated blood pressure means that the heart must work harder to pump blood. High blood pressure can also damage the walls of the arteries.'
 'Complications of high blood pressure include heart disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), eye damage, and stroke (brain damage). Hypertension is a major public health problem.'
 'The “silent killer” The “silent killer” Blood pressure can increase without any noticeable symptoms. You can have high blood pressure and experience no obvious symptoms until you experience a stroke or heart attack. In some people, severe high blood pressure can result in nosebleeds, headaches, or dizziness. Because hypertension can sneak up on you, it’s especially important to monitor your blood pressure regularly.'
 'Symptoms of extremely high blood pressure include the following: 1  Severe headaches. 2  Fatigue. 3  Vision problems.  Chest 1  pain. Difficulty breathing.  Irregular 1  heartbeat. Blood in the 2  urine. Pounding in the chest, neck, or  ears.'
 'If you are looking for a list of symptoms and signs of high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension), you won’t find them here. This is because most of the time, there are none. Myth: People with high blood pressure will experience symptoms, like nervousness, sweating, difficulty sleeping or facial flushing.'
 'The symptoms include high blood pressure, bladder problems, and sometimes sudden weight gain and swelling. Preeclampsia is a serious condition, contributing to about 13 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide. It’s usually a manageable complication, however.'
 'The primary symptoms of malignant hypertension is a blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage. Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include bleeding and swelling of blood vessels in the retina, anxiety, nosebleeds, severe headache, and shortness of breath.'
 ""A normal blood pressure is less than 120/80. High blood pressure is 140/90 or higher. If your blood pressure is between 120/80 and 140/90, you have what is called prehypertension, which means that if you don't take important steps, your elevated blood pressure can turn into high blood pressure.""]","High blood pressure (hypertension) often has no symptoms, which is why it's called a ""silent killer."" However, in severe cases, it may cause:

- Headaches
- Shortness of breath
- Nosebleeds
- Dizziness
- Blurred vision

Low blood pressure (hypotension) symptoms can include:

- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fainting
- Fatigue
- Nausea

is your veins blue because the blood color,"Yes, blood in your veins has very little oxygen and is a dark red color that looks almost blue when covered by your skin.","['Is blood ever blue and why does it appear blue in veins near the skin? I recently had a discussion in my biology class on what color blood is.Most of my class, including my biology teacher, were saying that blood is blue until the blood comes in contact with oxygen.'
 'The current mythology is that arterial blood and that exposed to the air (bleeding) is red because oxygen binds with the hemoglobin resulting is a red color. Venous blood is bluish because it is oxygen depleted which results in a blue color. The veins that carry the venous blood are just under the skin hence this is the blue blood you see. The arterial blood is carried in the arteries which are deep in the body and not seen through the skin.'
 ""1 Most veins carry deoxygenated blood, which is a darker color than oxygenated blood. The deep color of blood makes veins appear dark, too. 2  Different sizes of vessels appear different colors.  If you look closely at your veins, for example, along the inside of your wrist, you'll see your veins are not all the same color.""
 'Your blood is actually always red! Blood in your veins has very little oxygen and is a dark red color that looks almost blue when covered by your skin. Your arteries have bright red blood because it has a lot of oxygen in it that is being carried throughout your body to be used by tissues.'
 'Also, since the blood in your body is a lot darker, the veins appear darker. You may also notice that different sized blood vessels appear to be different colors. Another thing it can depend on is how you see color and how your brain perceives certain color against the color of your skin.'
 ""Human blood is red because of the iron in the haemoglobin. This gives red blood cells their red colour. Veinous blood is much darker than arterial blood, and your teacher is right that oxygenated (arterial) blood is 'redder' than deoxygenated (veinous) blood. However, human blood is not blue.""
 ""Everyone's skin is slightly different in color, so the veins can look different in different people, but blood is exactly the same color in everyone. It still doesn't look red. That's because we're seeing the *walls* of the veins too.""
 'One thing that makes no since if blood is blue is that when you have blood drawn directly from your veins into a vaccuum, the blood is still red, and it never touches oxygen. Also that oxygen is carried by blood cells, and so they would always be red anyway.'
 'Blood is always red. Veins look blue because light penetrates the skin to illuminate them, blue and red light (being of different wavelengths) penetrate with different degrees of success. What gets reflected back to our eyes is the blue light.'
 'I know that there are two types of blood and that venous blood is a very dark red, but NOT blue. Also that veins appear blue from that outside because of the color of skin. I would like some reputable information on the matter, and would like to show him proof that blood is not blue.']","No, veins appear blue due to the way light penetrates the skin and how it reflects off the blood in the veins.

does honey help acne,"Yes, honey help acne.","['If you apply acne to your face, you will have to wash it off. The antibacterial properties of honey are not strong enough to destroy significant amounts of bacteria if you just apply it to your face and rinse it off. Secondly, honey itself may clog pores. It is thick and sticky so you have to scrub it off. Failure to scrub it off may actually lead to new acne developing. Scrubbing may cause irritation and may increase inflammation in existing acne, worsening symptoms, increasing swelling, and possibly even cause scarring.'
 '1 Honey heals the wound caused by acne effectively due to its antiseptic properties that it gets from its hydrogen peroxide. Yes, hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced in honey by the enzyme glucose oxidase.  Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, honey is a very good remedy to get rid acne related discomforts.'
 'Eat a teaspoon of honey every day, put it on food, or add it to a cup of green tea. Combine honey with other foods like avocado, banana, milk, yogurt, pear, peach, lemon, aloe vera, egg white, cucumber, carrots, and orange juice. These foods offer additional benefits in treating acne. Use a cotton ball to apply a small amount of raw honey to the affected area.'
 'Bees fight off bacteria by adding antibacterial components to their honey. This helps prevent bacteria from growing and protects the young from infections. Theoretically, these same antibacterial properties could help fight off the infections that cause acne.'

swimming pool pump hours per day,Less than 6 hours per day.,"['We have a 25,000 gallon oval inground pool with a Hayward SP2607x10 pump. We need to know how many hours per day we are to run the pump. I have a Jandy variable speed 2hp ePump and I’m not sure what it’s GPM is in order to calculate run time. My pool is roughly 19000 gallons. Your GPM are affected by two main factors, your pipe size and your total dynamic head.'
 'Do swimming pool pumps have to run all the time? The pump is the main part of the swimming pool circulation system. The pumping system clears debris from the water and keeps chemicals mixed by pushing water into the filtration system and back out again.'
 ""Pump runs for 5 hours during peak time, 3 hours off-peak. Pump is OFF for 14 hours. Pool Season, normal to high use: roughly mid-June through the end of August (the beginning of the school year). Water temperatures are in the mid to upper 80's; air temperatures range from the mid 80's to low 90's.""
 'A proactive, productive and energy-saving maintenance activity is to remove the debris floating on the pool surface with a hand-held skimmer. One way to keep control of the time you run the swimming pool pump is to run it several times a day for short periods of time. If you want to activate the pump once a day, start with six hours, but never go lower than five hours, especially in the summer. If your pool is in constant use, you may need to run the pump for up to eight hours per day, frequently checking the water clarity and chemical balance. Using a smaller pump for fewer hours per day is effective and will drastically reduce your electricity bill.'
 'Temperature: Air & Water. During the off-season, with water temperatures below 60°, you can run the pool pump less than 6 hours per day, in most cases. But as the water warms up into the 70’s you should run the pool pump longer each day.'
 ""That's not a bad idea, but it's not the best. In an ideal world if cost wasn't an issue, running your pool pump 24 hours a day, 7 seven days each week from pool opening to closing, is the best way to care for your pool. Those folks who follow this routine have few if any water quality problems; instead they have a HUGE electric bill.""
 '40 (GPM) X 60 (minutes per hour) = 2400 gallons per hour. 20,000 (gallons) / 2400 (gallons per hour) = 8.3 hours. So in this case you would need to run your pump 8.3 hours per day for one circulation or “turnover” of water, which is right where you want to be in terms of run time.'
 'When the pool water reaches the 80’s, your water may need 2 turnovers to stay clean and clear, or 12 hours at a minimum. For pools that get very warm with long, sunny summer days, run the pump as much as 18 hours per day, or as needed, to keep the water clear. 50-60° – 4-6 hours per day. 60-70° – 6-8 hours per day. 70-80° – 8-12 hours per day. 80-90° – 12-18 hours per day. In short, run the pump more when the air & water temperatures rise – but also consider the other factors above; regarding filter effectiveness, water treatments and amount and type of debris and rain in the pool.'
 ""Pump is OFF for 12 hours. That's how I maintain a crystal clear pool. When the water does cloud up, usually because of a very heavy rain storm (one or more inches of rain water) or big party (lots of people with food and drink), then I'll run the pump 24/7 until it clears; that's typically no longer than one day.""
 'Many residential pools in the U.S. have 1.5-horsepower or 2-horsepower pumps that draw 2,000 watts or more. If you’re not paying attention, you may be running your pool pump for 24 hours a day — even though your pool might be perfectly clean with only 6 hours of pump operation per day.']","A swimming pool pump typically runs for about 8 to 12 hours per day, depending on factors like pool size, usage, and local climate.

what causes a root canal to become infected,The bacteria causes a root canal to become infected.,"[""A root canal is the usual treatment to cure the infection, so experiencing an abscessed tooth years after you've had a root canal can be a puzzling and alarming experience. You probably assumed that the root canal and crown took care of the initial problem.""
 'If a patient is informed that these root canal teeth remain infected; that bacteria can indeed travel to other sites in the body, and that bacteria in root canal teeth and the surrounding bone release potent toxins, then the patient can decide to have a root canal or not, he says.'
 ""Root canal therapy requires one or more office visits and can be performed by a dentist or endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who specializes in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the teeth's dental pulp.""
 'If a root canal infection is not taken care of in a timely manner, the infection can spread and will cause worse problems in the future. Learn what a root canal entails and the different root canal procedures that your dentist will discuss with you at your consultation.'
 'All Root Canal Teeth Will Become More Infected Over Time. Because root canal teeth no longer have a blood supply, the bacteria remaining inside all root canal teeth are effectively hidden from the immune system. To make matters worse, the root canal tooth becomes more infected over time due to the influx of bacteria from the gum tissue surrounding the tooth.'
 'Root canal therapy is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or infected. Root canal therapy is performed when the pulp which is composed of nerves and blood vessels in the tooth becomes infected or damaged. During root canal therapy, the pulp is removed, and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed.'
 'The presence of oral bacteria from root canal teeth and gum disease in the arterial plaque and blood clots of heart attack patients points to direct causation, rather than correlation between oral infection and cardiovascular disease. All Root Canal Teeth Will Become More Infected Over Time Because root canal teeth no longer have a blood supply, the bacteria remaining inside all root canal teeth are effectively hidden from the immune system.'
 'Just like a tooth can develop a cavity, a root canal can become infected and require treatment called root canal therapy (RCT). During root canal therapy, your dentist will clean and seal the entire root canal to prevent future infections in the nerve tissue or pulp. When this infected tissue or pulp is not treated, it breaks down and bacteria can cause an abscess, or infection of the mouth, face, jaw, or throat.'
 'When pulp is damaged, it breaks down, and bacteria begin to multiply within the pulp chamber. The bacteria and other dying pulp remnants can cause an infection or abscessed tooth. An abscess is a pus-filled pocket that forms at the end of a tooth’s root. In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause:'
 'Inadequate Root Canal. The goal of root canal therapy is to completely clean the inflamed or infected tissue from the affected tooth root, and then totally seal the emptied pulp canal to the tip of the root. But debris left in the end of the pulp canal can harbor bacteria that may cause an infection. Likewise, if the root canal filling is extruded beyond the tip of the tooth root, an subsequent infection may develop.']","A root canal can become infected due to:

1. **Bacterial Infection**: Bacteria entering the tooth via deep decay, cracks, or trauma.
2. **Inadequate Seal**: Poor sealing during previous dental work allowing bacteria to enter.
3. **Infection Recurrence**: Persistent bacteria from previous treatments or reinfection.
4. **Gum Disease**: Infection spreading from gum tissue to the tooth pulp.

These factors can lead to inflammation, pain, and further infection in the tooth.",1

Tired eye is another term for what is commonly known as eyestrain – when eyes feel achy, weak, or heavy due to intense use. It is not a disease, and does not require medical treatment – but it never hurts to know how to prevent it. Tired eyes can come from any number of activities.'
 'In some instances, the eyes may look tired but you may not be tired. In people born with thicker eyelids, the eyes appear to droop. As people age, fat can accumulate around the eyes, and the extra tissue can make the eyes look tired. This is often described as bags under the eyes.'
 ""The eyes are not only windows to the soul - but to your general health. If you are ill, or just under the weather, the first place it's likely to show is in your eyes. Amy Anderson spoke to Professor Alistair Fielder, ophthalmologist at Imperial College, London, to find out what signs to look for.""
 'It is also common to have tired eyes at the end of a long day, after many hours of concentration during which you must keep your eyes open. Staring at a computer, reading, scanning, watching — whatever your eyes do is a workout for the eye and eyelid muscles. Most of the time, tired eyes are simply a sign of muscle fatigue.'
 ""Hello, I am 23 years old and have had bags under my eyes all my life no matter how much sleep I get. Recently in the last year, I've noticed major under eye wrinkles as well. I suspect this is probably from the sun. I started throwing a retinol cream into my nightly regime plus I use moisturizer with sunscreen everyday. However, I have not seen any results!""

 'Injury to the abdominal wall, muscle strain, hernia and irritation or infection of the peritoneum (peritonitis) are some of the abdominal wall causes of pain above the right hip. The symptoms for these conditions can vary but severe abdominal tenderness is present with the pain.'
 'Age may also play a role in that some conditions are more likely to occur in children while other conditions are common causes of pain above the right hip in adults and the elderly. The conditions listed below are not the only possible causes of pain.'
 'There are a number of different causes of pain above the right hip. The problem may be with the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract or female reproductive system. The character and severity of pain can vary depending on the site that is located and the underlying disease that causes it.'
 'Now it happens fairly often and is debilitating when it happens. A few minutes ago I was watching a movie with my kids and it hit me -- these sharp, quick, pulses of intense pain, like high volts of electricity sheering exactly in my right hip joint.

 'Organs Located Above The Right Hip. The hip is the joint where the acetabulum of the pelvic bone and the head of the femur meet. Most people refer to the pelvic bones as the hip, and more specifically the uppermost portion of it which is known as the ilium. The part that is easily felt is the iliac crest.']","Sharp pain near the right hip can be caused by several factors, including:

1. **Muscle Strain** - Overexertion or injury to hip or surrounding muscles.
2. **Hip Bursitis** - Inflammation of the bursae in the hip joint.
3. **Tendinitis** - Inflammation of tendons around the hip.
4. **Arthritis** - Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hip joint.
5. **Sciatica** - Nerve pain radiating from the lower back affecting the hip area.
6. **Hernia** - Inguinal or femoral hernia can cause localized pain.
7. **Fractures** - Stress fractures or hip fractures, especially in older adults.
8. **Appendicitis** - Pain can sometimes be referred to the hip area.
9. **Referred Pain** - Issues from other areas like the lower back or abdominal organs.

what carries a positive electrical charge,Protons.,"['One property of charge is that two positive charges and two negative charges near each other will want to repel, while opposite charges near each other will want to attract. All of that information is transmitted by the electric field to other surrounding charged particles.'
 'Electrons are designated to be the carriers of negative charge. The assignment of negative and positive to electrons and protons respectively can be attributed to Benjamin Franklin. He could have easily reversed this designation. Like all charged particles, negative charges create electric fields around them.'
 'Electrons can move more easily in some objects than in others. If you put a charge on things like glass, plastic, rubber, and wood, that charge stays where you put it. We say the charges are static, and we call this static electricity. Materials like glass and plastic are called insulators, or nonconductors.'
 'One is electrons, which carry a negative electric charge. In addition, it is convenient to treat the traveling vacancies in the valence band electron population (holes) as the second type of charge carrier, which carry a positive charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron.'
 'Separating Charges. Atoms start out with the same number of negative charges (electrons), and positive charges (protons). Under certain conditions, electrons can be removed from, or added to atoms. Removing electrons would leave the atom with more positives than negatives, and we call this a positive ion (An ion is a charged atom).'

Each family (elements in a column going up and down) in the periodic table has its own characteristic properties based on ____. Each dot stands for one valence electron.'
 'A water molecule is a __ molecule because the oxygen atom pulls electrons closer to it than the hydrogen atoms do, forming a molecule that is slightly more positive at one end than at the other.'
 'By definition, a thing with negative electric charge is negatively charged, so the question as asked is answered yes, tautologically.. Of course, this is referring to the charge of the planet sans atmosphere. The atmosphere has a nearly equal opposite charge, and the charge separation between the ground and the ionosphere is what enables things like lightning. See Wikipedia or one of its references.1.'
 'Charge carrier. In physics, a charge carrier is a particle free to move, carrying an electric charge, especially the particles that carry electric charges in electrical conductors. Examples are electrons, ions and holes.'
 'Whenever an atom contains excess negative charge, it is called a negative ion. This means that the atom picked up negative charges from another atom. The atom that lost the electrons becomes a positive ion. When a substance picks up or loses electrons, its called triboelectricity.']","Protons carry a positive electrical charge.

how long can you have thawed chicken in refrigerator before you must use,"It will thaw throughout the day in the fridge, but not get below 40 degrees F.","['When you bring it home, if you are not going to cook it immediately, it can last indefinitely if it is frozen consistently until you thaw it for eating. So toss it in the freezer immediately and cryogenize that chicken (which virtual stops the aging part of the equation).'
 ""I have to say that I have kept chicken in the fridge for longer than 2 days and not died. Some even have best before dates 3-4 days in. The quality definitely suffers, and I'm sure there's some risk, but it's probably low.""
 'On the day you want to eat the chicken, that morning, move it from the freezer to the fridge. It will thaw throughout the day in the fridge, but not get below 40 degrees F. That is the key. Bacteria will grow at hotter than 40F (which solved the bacteria part of the equation).'
 ""While the refrigerator is a modern-day miracle that lets us store perishable food safely for longer periods of time than room temperature allows, there is a limit to how long raw proteins can be refrigerated before they should be cooked. Here's a guide to help you know how long you can keep cuts of meat around! Kitchen Fact: Raw ground meats and poultry should be cooked in 2 days, and roasts, steaks, and chops should be cooked in five days. For raw poultry, ground meats, and other chopped-up cuts of meat, cook them within two days.""
 'How and how long you store chicken is very important to keeping your food safe. When freezing chicken, always label it so you know how long it’s been in your freezer. 1  Whole chicken: 2-3 days.'
 ""I've accidentally left raw chicken in the refrigerator and forgotten about it before, and it started to smell off after about 4 days. I hate to say it, but I wouldn't use it at this point. As for the steak, you're probably okay, because you only have surface bacteria, but I would cook it well and right away.""
 ""It's a better practice to keep thing in freezer if you don't cook within a day, but some fridge like mine has a cooler box that has lower than usual temp that I may leave my uncooked meat a little bit longer, but 3 days are the max.""
 'Most microwaves have a poultry defrost setting, so use that if you have it. If not, a general rule to use is about 10 – 15 minutes per kilogram or 5 minutes per pound. Be sure to check your chicken often to ensure that it is thawing evenly and not overcooking or drying out. To thaw chicken faster, place it wrapped in a bowl of cold water in the sink. It is important that the water is cold, as warm water can encourage bacteria growth. Additionally, it’s important that the water be changed every 30 minutes to maintain the temperature of the water.'
 ""Larger cuts — like roasts, steaks, and chops — can be stored a bit longer, but should be used within five days. If you don't have time to cook the meat at the end of these time periods, just freeze it, as freezing will halt any bacteria growth.""
 'A couple of things to keep in mind with this defrosting method: -Some areas of the fridge are colder than others, which could prolong the thawing process. -After thawing in the fridge, poultry, ground meat and stew meat will stay good in the fridge for 1-2 days. Red meat cuts will stay good for up to 3-5 days. -You can refreeze meat thawed in the fridge.

what is iq test,An assessment of your ability to think and reason.,"[""These things may affect your score. Additionally, IQ is not the be all end all of a person's abilities in life.

Today we attempt to write tests that will determine an adult's true mental potential, unbiased by culture, and compare scores to the scores of other adults who have taken the same test.""
 'IQ tests use a standardized scale with 100 as the median score. On most tests, a score between 90 and 110, or the median plus or minus 10, indicates average intelligence. A score above 130 indicates exceptional intelligence and a score below 70 may indicate mental retardation. Like their predecessors, modern tests do take in to account the age of a child when determining an IQ score. Children are graded relative to the population at their developmental level.'

can body scanners detect disease,Yes,"['We can take an image of the suspected area on the skin surface and under the skin surface at different depths to see if there is anything that looks totally different under the normal tissue, Dr. Anis Rahman, the chief technology officer of Applied Research and Photonics, explained to the press on Wednesday.'
 'The body scan may detect early or advanced heart disease, aneurysms of the aorta, vascular disease, lung tumors, kidney tumors and liver tumors, calcified kidney stones, calcified gallstones, and certain abnormalities in the abdominal and pelvic region.'
 'Full body scanning can detect heart, lung, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and prostate and ovarian disease as well as tumors, aneurysms, osteoporosis, hernias, and kidney and gall stones. Full body scanning is performed on a multislice computed tomography (CT) scanner in only 30 seconds. This study provides both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images of all types of tissue, allowing for more accurate detection of various cancers and diseases before symptoms occur.'
 'Why is full body scanning important? Heart and lung disease are responsible for more than half of all deaths in the United Stateseach year. In 2002, approximately 1,284,900 individuals will be diagnosed with cancer and 555,500 will die of some form of cancer.'
 'As a result, they are diagnosed after symptoms have occurred, when therapy is no longer effective. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 3% to 35% of cancer deaths could be avoided through screening. Full body scanning can easily detect various cancers and common malignancies that a standard physical can miss.'
 'Body Scan Information. Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death in the United States, accounting for almost 3 out of every 4 deaths. The body scan, performed in a matter of minutes, screens for the presence of heart disease, certain cancers, as well as other abnormalities.'
 'This disease often starts in the pigment-producing cells located in the deepest part of the outer layer of the skin. Changes begin to occur at this location long before people start seeing the strange mole symptoms on the visible part of the skin.'
 'The body scan includes a heart scan and lung scan and following areas of the abdomen: kidneys, spine, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, adrenal glands, lymph nodes, spleen, and certain pelvic organs.'
 'The technology that is used in airport security scanners has the potential to be a skin cancer diagnostic tool, a scientist is claiming. The scanners use so-called terahertz radiation (t-rays), which has the ability to look through human skin and tissue. T-rays are considered non-ionizing, similar to visible light.'
 'Because the images are obtained in a fast manner, the risk of exposure to radiation is minimal. The Total Body CT scan analyzes three major areas of the body: the lungs, the heart, and the abdomen/pelvis. The lung CT can detect early, potentially malignant nodules.']","Body scanners can detect some abnormalities, such as tumors or foreign objects, but they are not specifically designed to diagnose diseases.

Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.Commercially, fructose is frequently derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and corn.hen fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed.'

how long does coconut oil last,Unopened last for a year and Opened last 6 months.,"['Shelf Life Of Coconut Oil. Every bottle or jar of coconut oil should have a “use-by”, “sell-by” or other expiration date. It’s just a rough estimate and it informs you that in almost all cases coconut oil will be fine up to that date. Sometimes it’s 1.5 years, sometimes 4 years.'
 'How To Store Coconut Oil. Most vegetables oils should be stored in the pantry or in the fridge. Coconut oil gives you a little wider area of choices. You can store it in the pantry, in the fridge or in room temperature. The thing you need to know is that its melting point is around 75 °F (ca. 24 °C). If there’s hotter in the room where you keep it, it should be liquid.'
 'How much coconut oil should be taken daily to receive its health benefits? The health benefits of coconut oil are mainly from the medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs). An adult needs about 3.5 tablespoons of organic virgin coconut oil a day according to researchers. It is recommended to take this amount throughout the day with food high in fibre and protein. Make coconut oil diet part of your day to day life.'
 'First thing you should know is that coconut oil can be stored as liquid or solid, it’s up to you. It has a melting point of about 75 F (24 C), so if the temperature in the room where you keep it is higher than that, it’ll be liquid. If the temperature is below the melting point, the oil will be solid.'
 'Unopened, it should last for a year in the pantry. Opened, it will last 6 months in the pantry, 8 months in the fridge, and 1 year in the freezer. (Source: Virginia Cooperative Extension “Food Storage Guidelines for Consumers”) Coconut oil: Refined coconut oil will last about 18 months without turning rancid.'
 'Packaged shredded coconut is shelved with baking ingredients. Unopened, it should last for a year in the pantry. Opened, it will last 6 months in the pantry, 8 months in the fridge, and 1 year in the freezer. Coconut oil: Refined coconut oil will last about 18 months without turning rancid. Purified, unrefined coconut oil will last indefinitely.'
 'It’s pretty safe to assume that coconut oil should be fine for at least 1.5 years, but in most cases it’ll be fine for considerably longer period of time, like 3 or 4 years. As long as you can’t spot any signs of spoilage, coconut oil is fine to use.'
 'Store homemade coconut butter in a sealed container or glass jar. There is no need to refrigerate it, and the coconut butter will last for at least a few months in the pantry… that is if you don’t eat it all first! Mine lasts for about a day.'
 'When it comes to coconut oil, that expiration date is pretty tricky – manufacturers place different dates on their products. It might be one year, two years or even four years, it depends. Because of that, you can safely assume that every coconut oil lasts at least a year, but a few years is the most common scenario. Here’s a rule of thumb: as long as you can’t notice your coconut oil is bad, it’s fine.'
 'Coconut oil is one of the vegetable oils and it has all kinds of uses. It’s very popular in tropics, where it’s often used as a source of fat. If you use coconut oil on a regular basis, it’s a good idea to know a thing or two about how it should be stored, how long does it last or how you can tell if it’s bad.']","Unopened coconut oil can last about 2 to 3 years.

They just reflect what you previously saw as a red sunset. Remember that clouds are merely water droplets along with some impurities such as dust and airborne pollutants. Jun 27, 2009 #3.'
 'Cumuliform cloudscape over Swifts Creek, Australia. In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol comprising a visible mass of minute liquid droplets or frozen crystals, both of which are made of water or various chemicals. The droplets or particles are suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. On Earth, clouds are formed by the saturation of air in the homosphere (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere). The air may be cooled to its dew point by a variety of atmospheric processes or it may gain moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source. Nephology is the science of clouds which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.'
 'The colour of a cloud also depends on the colour of the light that illuminates it. When sunlight passes through thick layer of atmosphere and dust particles at sunset, blue colour is scattered by Rayleigh Scattering and only red-to-orange color remains (see Question 2). The clouds reflect these unscattered red/orange rays and appear in that colour (Figure 6).'
 'Why is the color of the clouds dark pink in the night as compared to the black sky? Also..why is it white in the morning when the sky is blue..(is it because the cloud molecules scatter red wavelengths along with the blue ones?'
 '“It was my first time to see a rare cloud phenomenon like this.” Thank you, Kino! Sky watchers sometimes report seeing rainbow colors within clouds. These colorful clouds are called iridescent clouds. When you see a cloud like this, you know there are especially tiny ice crystals or water droplets in the air. Larger ice crystals produce solar or lunar halos, but tiny ice crystals or water droplets cause light to be diffracted – spread out – creating this rainbow-like effect in the clouds.'
 'What causes rainbow colors in clouds? Iridescent clouds – clouds with rainbow colors – happen when especially tiny water droplets or small ice crystals individually scatter light. Kino Obusan caught these iridescent clouds – one on the right and one on the left – on July 15, 2016 from Batangas, Philippines.'
 'Since light undergoes multiple scattering between numerous water droplets or ice crystals in all direction (Figure 1) and they are weakly absorbing to visible light of all wavelengths, the scattered light of all wavelengths constitutes the white color of clouds (Figure 2) that we observe.'
 'Confidence votes 304. All clouds are white when viewed from space. However, the color of a cloud can be changed when light is refracted through the particles that make up the cloud, or when viewing clouds at sunrise or sunset. Dust and other pollutants can also cause light to refract and change the color of a cloud. At the surface, we often see clouds of various colors.'
 'Since the Earth is spherical, the clouds at different heights turn red at different time when the sun crosses the horizon (Figure 7). Just before the sunset, the color of low clouds (e.g. stratus) will turn red first. Shortly after the sunset, the high clouds (e.g. cirrus) would be gradually stained in deep red and become apparent under the darken background.'
 ""Jun 27, 2009 #5. Science Advisor. Education Advisor. The color of the clouds comes from scattering, and there are many, many relevant scattering processes that can occur depending on the relative positions of the sources (sun, 'light pollution'), the observer (you) and clouds; the composition of the clouds, the polarization dependence, etc. etc.""]","Clouds are typically white or gray, but they can appear in various colors depending on the time of day and weather conditions.",0

what does conductive mean,Having conductivity,"[""In physics, thermal conductivity (often denoted k, λ, or κ) is the property of a material to conduct heat. It is evaluated primarily in terms of Fourier's Law for heat conduction.

how is a rudder used,Rudder is used to help maintain stability in the roll.,"[""The key in flying a good roll is to keep the aircraft's nose up in anticipation of the lift requirement when flying in knife-edge or inverted flight. 1  Since in knife-edge the elevator and rudder will assume each others function, you will need rudder as well as elevator for directional and pitch control.""
 'The rudder is the small moving section at the rear of the stabilizer that is attached to the fixed sections by hinges. Because the rudder moves, it varies the amount of force generated by the tail surface and is used to generate and control the yawing motion of the aircraft. This slide shows what happens when the pilot deflects the rudder, a hinged section at the rear of the vertical stabilizer. The rudder is used to control the position of the nose of the aircraft. Interestingly, it is NOT used to turn the aircraft in flight.'
 ""Flight control surfaces. Aircraft flight control surfaces are aerodynamic devices allowing a pilot to adjust and control the aircraft's flight attitude. Development of an effective set of flight control surfaces was a critical advance in the development of aircraft.""
 'The answer in all three cases is that rudder is used to help maintain stability in the roll. A little rudder at just the right time can help keep the nose up in a slow roll or even an aileron roll, as the plane rotates through the sideways portions of the roll when gravity is otherwise not countered.'
 'At the rear of the fuselage of most aircraft one finds a vertical stabilizer and a rudder. The stabilizer is a fixed wing section whose job is to provide stability for the aircraft, to keep it flying straight. The vertical stabilizer prevents side-to-side, or yawing, motion of the aircraft nose.'
 'Also, depending on adverse yaw, some rudder is required to hold yaw to zero when applying ailerons. The procedure is as follows: Speed up, so you are fast enough for roll maneuvering and inverted flight. Pitch up a few degrees. How much depends on wing incidence and zero-lift angle of attack.'
 'The procedure is as follows: 1  Speed up, so you are fast enough for roll maneuvering and inverted flight. 2  Pitch up a few degrees. 3  Stop the pitching motion, then apply full ailerons. 4  With increasing roll angle, apply rudder to keep the nose up. 5  Keep the rotation rate and push the stick more when changing from 90° to 180° roll angle.'
 'The rudder is a fundamental control surface which is typically controlled by pedals rather than at the stick. It is the primary means of controlling yaw—the rotation of an airplane about its vertical axis. The rudder may also be called upon to counter-act the adverse yaw produced by the roll-control surfaces. If rudder is continuously applied in level flight the aircraft will yaw initially in the direction of the applied rudder – the primary effect of rudder. After a few seconds the aircraft will tend to bank in the direction of yaw.'
 'The development of effective flight controls is what allowed stable flight. This article describes the control surfaces used on a fixed-wing aircraft of conventional design. Other fixed-wing aircraft configurations may use different control surfaces but the basic principles remain.'
 'This effect of the rudder is commonly used in model aircraft where if sufficient diheral or polyhedral is included in the wing design, primary roll control such as ailerons may be omitted altogether. Turning the aircraft Edit']","A rudder is used to steer a vehicle, typically a boat or aircraft. It directs the flow of water or air, allowing the vessel to turn left or right. In boats, the rudder is positioned at the stern and moves in opposition to the desired direction; in aircraft, it's located at the tail and controls yaw.",1

 'Causes Of Anovulatory Cycles. Anovulatory cycles are common phenomena at the beginning of the reproductive life of a woman, when periods first begin (menarche). Later, as the ovaries become increasingly active, eggs are released every month during the cycle.'
 'Anovulation is the failure of the ovary to release ova over a period of time generally exceeding 3 months. The normal functioning ovary releases one ovum every 25–28 days. This average time between ovulation events is variable, especially during puberty and the perimenopause period.

when to plant lily bulbs,Early spring or mid- to late fall.,"['How to plant lily bulbs in a pot. Fill gaps in your summer planting displays with brightly-coloured lilies for a temporary, but timely, burst of colour. Plant lily bulbs into pots then simply drop them, pot and all, into arrangements on the patio, or even in your borders. Lily bulbs.'
 'The best time to plant lily bulbs is either early spring or mid- to late fall. Lilies prefer cool soil (below 60 degrees) to root properly; planting in warm soil will lead to weak plants and smaller flowers. After the first year they will rebound from the transplant and perform well.'
 'Finish with a layer of gravel or horticultural grit to help keep the compost moist. Keep the pot in a greenhouse or sheltered spot while the bulbs develop, tying tall varieties to canes as they grow. Move the pot to its final position when the plants are ready to flower.'
 'Lilies and ferns like moisture, so it is important to water them after you plant and water them during dry periods. Lilies enjoy bulb food and mulch in the spring. Remember when you are planting that it is best to plant in a patch keeping the bulbs grouped together so when they flower it makes a statement.'
 'The best planting depth for bulbs is generally three times the size of the bulb. For oriental lilies, 6-inches is a good depth. Asiatics can be planted 4 to 5 inches deep. Adding some bulb food or bone meal gives them some phosphorus to start. Interplant the ferns and lilies by planting them in an alternating pattern 10 inches apart.'
 'Place five or six lily bulbs on the surface, with their roots on the compost and their growing tips facing upwards. Cover the bulbs with a generous layer of compost, taking the compost level to around 5cm below the pot rim. Firm well and water thoroughly, adding more compost afterwards if the level falls.'
 'If the weather turns nasty in the fall before you can get your lilies in the ground, you can wait until spring to plant them. Until you are able to plant, keep your bulbs in dry straw or sawdust in a dark, cold location such as an unheated garage. When your soil is workable in early spring, you can plant your lilies. Workable soil means that when you squeeze a handful of dirt, it crumbles. If your soil forms a solid ball or drizzles mud when squeezed, it is too wet to be worked. Spring is also the right time to plant Stargazer lilies in containers.'
 'Scoop out a hole to a depth of 4 to 6 inches to plant the lily bulb. Space individual bulb 6 to 12 inches from nearby lily bulbs to allow plenty of room for foliage growth. Place the bulb in the hole with the nose (pointy part) pointing upwards and fill in around the entire bulb with the amended soil mixture.'
 'Lilies come in a wide variety of styles from traditional white flowers to exotic Tiger lilies with unique patterns on the flower petals. This bulb plant has many options in height for adding variety to the garden. Lily bulbs grow incredibly well in well-drained soil in the full sun. Learning how to plant lily bulbs involves the creation of the healthiest site possible for the newly planted bulbs. Proper watering and division when needed helps this lovely plant multiply and thrive as a landscape mainstay.'
 'Fall is the ideal time to plant Stargazer lilies in the ground. This gives the bulbs time to put down roots before winter sets in. This is also an excellent time to divide and transplant any established lilies you have in your garden. New bulbs should be planted as soon as possible after buying them. Try to plant in early fall when the weather is still pleasant and before heavy rains make your soil too wet to work.']",Lily bulbs are best planted in the spring after the last frost or in the fall about six weeks before the ground freezes.,0
