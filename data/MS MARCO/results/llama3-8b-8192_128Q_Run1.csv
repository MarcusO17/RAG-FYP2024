['No Answer Present.'],why is first born always lighter skin tone,"[""Color is not entirely uniform across an individual's skin; for example, the skin of the palm and the sole is lighter than most other skin, and this is especially noticeable in darker-skinned people.""
 ""Human skin color ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest hues. An individual's skin pigmentation is the result of genetics, being the product of both of the individual's biological parents' genetic makeup.""
 'We do not even see her in the faces of our black female pop stars. Take Rihanna, Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj, all light-skinned with European features and blond weaves. Even in the world of fashion, the image of the black woman has been all but erased from the catwalk.'
 ""It's the natural, unchangeable pigment of their skin, just like white skin. It doesn't turn that color through sunlight or anything. Another View Actuall…y, some are born with very light skin that gradually darkens during the first few weeks of life. Others are born with the skin tone they will have for life.""
 'Colourism also manifests in the romantic realm. Because fair skin is associated with beauty and status, light-skinned black women are more likely to be married than darker-skinned black women. Light skin is so coveted that whitening creams continue to sell well in the US, Asia and Africa.'
 'Africans have a wide variation of skin tones”. It is certainly true that there is a wide range of “African” skin tone, facial features etc. Just watching the Olympics, you see the differences between the typical Ethiopian, Kenyan and Nigerian athletes for example.'
 'Black babies are not always born white, although some are quite light. Even when they are born lighter, there are usually differences in the tone of their skin. Many lighter b…abies have visible changes of skin tone even within hours of being born.'
 'Many self-identified white Americans also have a small percentage of African heritage. Based on our current understanding of the genetics behind skin tone, we know that the level of skin pigmentation is controlled by multiple genes working in combination. The result of this is a gradient of skin tones from rich browns to sun-kissed beiges that are lighter than your average Southern European.'
 'Because fair skin is associated with beauty and status, light-skinned black women are more likely to be married than darker-skinned black women. We find that the light-skin shade as measured by survey interviewers is associated with about a 15% greater probability of marriage for young black women..'
 'Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis.']","Based on the provided context, it seems that the assumption ""first born always lighter skin tone"" is not entirely accurate. The context mentions that ""Black babies are not always born white, although some are quite light. Even when they are born lighter, there are usually differences in the tone of their skin. Many lighter babies have visible changes of skin tone even within hours of being born.""

Additionally, the context states that ""Many self-identified white Americans also have a small percentage of African heritage.

It appears that skin tone is determined by a combination of genetic factors, and it's not necessarily the case that the first-born child will always have a lighter skin tone. I don't know of any specific research or studies that would support the claim that first-born children are always lighter-skinned.",1,

['20 foot'],how tall is an understory tree,"[""The pagoda dogwood (Cornus alternifolia) is very attractive in the spring. The flowers aren't fully open yet in this photo, but note the horizontal branching structure. This is why it's called pagoda dogwood. Ironically, this makes it sound like it's not native, but it's one of our finest native understory plants.""
 'Some Good Understory Trees. I started with this tree with big tropical like leaves because if you like how it looks, it meets the needs of a small understory tree with distinct trunks. It can be difficult to transplant and should be planted as a small tree (3-6′) to have better luck with it.'
 ""We have three eastern serviceberries (aka shadbush) that provide many berries for birds early in the season. In fact, they're sometimes called Juneberries.. Robins, catbirds, chickadees, and cardinals especially like them. It has beautiful flowers in the spring and gorgeous fall color.""
 'Vanderwolf Limber Pine which grows 40-50′ tall and only 20′ wide instead of a white pine which could grow to 60-80′ tall and 40′ wide. Threeflower maple and Paperbark maple, two outstanding trees which won’t get much taller than about 25 feet.'
 'Trees are the tallest specimens. Underneath grows the understory level of smaller trees and shrubs. The ground level is the place for herbaceous perennials or annuals. You probably already have a few tall trees in your backyard that form the skeleton of the shade garden. Read on for understory planting tips.'
 'Page 1 of 3 pages of Our Trees. Serviceberry is a wonderful three-season plant. We have three eastern serviceberries (aka shadbush) that provide many berries for birds early in the season. Robins, catbirds, chickadees, and cardinals especially like them.'
 'Understory trees and shrubs will be more limited if the tall trees already in the garden offer deep shade, like most maple trees. Use types of understory plants that grow in low light. These include small trees like basswood, yellow birch and Kentucky coffee tree.'
 ""Surprisingly, there are more shade-loving small palm trees than there are sun-lovers. But, when you think about it, this is natural as these understory palms by their nature don't penetrate the upper canopy and prefer filtered light. As we approach the 20 foot mark, there are a lot more sun palms than shade species.""
 'I prefer to buy trees that will mature to an appropriate height for their spot. I have talked about some of my favorites in past posts, including: Fox Valley River Birch which grows about 12 feet in 15 years instead of a Heritage River Birch which can get 40-70 feet tall.'

 'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood.'

The liver plays important roles: It stores energy from food, makes proteins, and helps remove toxins. The liver also makes bile, a fluid that helps in digestion.'
 'The hepatic function panel evaluates: 1  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This enzyme, found in the liver, plays a role in metabolism, the process that converts food into energy. If the liver is injured, ALT is released into the bloodstream. Its levels are especially high with acute hepatitis. 2  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP).'

 'Periodically to evaluate liver function; whenever you are at risk for liver injury; when you are taking medications that may affect your liver; when you have a liver disease; when you have symptoms associated with liver damage, such as jaundice.'

Scammers may use your VIN to clone your car, which means they create a fake vehicle with the same VIN as your car. This can be done to sell the fake car or to commit insurance fraud.

It's also possible that scammers may use your VIN to obtain a Carfax or Carproof report, which can provide them with information about your car's history, including any accidents or damage it may have been in. This information can be used to negotiate a lower price for the car or to sell it to an unsuspecting buyer.

To protect yourself from VIN scams, it's a good idea to be cautious when sharing your VIN with someone you don't know. Only provide your VIN to a legitimate buyer or a reputable dealership, and make sure you have a clear understanding of what they plan to do with the information.

Continue subtracting 82.31 from each number in the data set. 3) Now square each of the values so that you now have all positive values.""
 'Measures of Spread. Introduction. A measure of spread, sometimes also called a measure of dispersion, is used to describe the variability in a sample or population. It is usually used in conjunction with a measure of central tendency, such as the mean or median, to provide an overall description of a set of data.'
 'Statisticians use summary measures to describe the amount of variability or spread in a set of data. The most common measures of variability are the range, the interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation. View Video Lesson The Range. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of values. For example, consider the following numbers: 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 11. For this set of numbers, the range would be 11 - 1 or 10. The Interquartile Range (IQR) The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles. Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that divide each part are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively. 1  Q1 is the middle value in the first half of the rank-ordered data set. 2  Q2 is the median value in the set. 3  Q3 is the middle value in the second half of the rank-ordered data set.'
 'Measures of Spread Introduction. A measure of spread, sometimes also called a measure of dispersion, is used to describe the variability in a sample or population. It is usually used in conjunction with a measure of central tendency, such as the mean or median, to provide an overall description of a set of data.'
 'Statistical variability and distributions. Analyze the shape of a graph to describe the distribution of data. Describe the shape of a dot plot. Describe the distribution of data using the mean absolute deviation. Express mean, median, and mode. Identify clusters, peaks and gaps in a dot plot.'
 'We will be looking at the range, quartiles, variance, absolute deviation and standard deviation. Range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores in a data set and is the simplest measure of spread. So we calculate range as: Range = maximum value - minimum value. For example, let us consider the following data set: The maximum value is 85 and the minimum value is 23. This results in a range of 62, which is 85 minus 23. Whilst using the range as a measure of spread is limited, it does set the boundaries of the scores. This can be useful if you are measuring a variable that has either a critical low or high threshold (or both) that should not be crossed. The range will instantly inform you whether at least one value broke these critical thresholds.'

It helps describe the variability of the data set by setting the boundaries of the scores. This can be useful if you are measuring a variable that has either a critical low or high threshold (or both) that should not be crossed.

For example, if the range of a data set is 62, it means that the highest score is 85 and the lowest score is 23. This gives you an idea of the spread of the data and can help you identify if any values are outside the expected range.

Additionally, the range can be used to identify clusters, peaks, and gaps in a dot plot. A cluster is a group of data points that are close together, a peak is a group of data points that are higher than the surrounding data points, and a gap is a group of data points that are lower than the surrounding data points.

['After three to four days.'],medication to delay menstrual period,"['I am about to get married next month and my period coincides with the date of my wedding night or ‘suhaag raat’. I am really upset about it. Please tell me how I can delay my period by 3 or 4 days minimum, if this is not possible then can I get my periods 7 days early so that I can enjoy my wedding night.'
 'Visit Your Gynecologist. Medications are the most common, and the safest, way to postpone your menstrual period. Your period is a result of various hormones, including estrogen, working in your body. To prevent menstruation for any length of time, you will need to alter those hormones, usually through taking other hormones.'
 'If you take a combined contraceptive pill, you can delay your period by taking two packets back-to-back. How you do this will depend on which pill you take. Examples are: Monophasic 21-day pills – you take a combined pill for 21 days, followed by seven days without pills, when you have a bleed.'
 ""If you were unable to get a prescription for medication to delay your menstrual cycle, there are still a couple other options. Even though it won't prevent your period, a diaphragm, a small cup placed near your cervix before intercourse, can stop the flow from your period for a short amount of time.""
 'The only period delay medication to buy in the UK is Norethisterone, which should be taken a couple of days prior to your periods starting until you wish to stop. Norethisterone can be taken for a number of weeks, regarding of your situation, and is available to order online from euroClinix.'
 'Period delay is when you take a treatment, which usually contains a high dose of artificial progesterone, to push back the start of your period. Progesterone occurs naturally in the female body where it plays a key role during the menstrual cycle.'
 'When some doctors are asked What is a safe way to delay my menstrual period?, not all of them turn immediately to traditional birth control, especially if you have only a few days before your period is due. Some medications, such as norethisterone, can delay menstruation after only three to four days.'
 'Using the mini pill as a way to delay your period will depend on your scenario. For example, a minority of women find that they never experience periods whilst taking their mini pill contraceptive. This accounts for around 20% of women and simply carrying on with this medication is a suitable period delay option.'
 'This is a fairly common worry most brides-to-be have. Do not worry; stress will only cause an upheaval in your menstrual cycle and hormones. As for your periods, unfortunately, it is not possible to prepone them. However, there are medications that can postpone or delay your periods by a few days. These pills are hormonal medications that help to increase the amount of progesterone, which causes your body to signal the start of your menstruation or periods.'
 ""However, thanks to the help of period delay medications, you now have the option to push back the start of your period for a couple of weeks until it's convenient. This can happen with certain types of birth control pills as well as medication Norethisterone that is specifically designed to delay your period. These treatments delay your period by controlling when the womb lining is shed, which provides control over when your period starts for whatever reason you decide to delay.""]","I understand your concern about your period coinciding with your wedding night. There are medications available that can help delay your menstrual period. 

According to the provided context, medications like combined contraceptive pills, norethisterone, and mini pills can be used to delay your period. These medications work by altering the hormones in your body, which regulate your menstrual cycle.

For example, taking two packets of combined contraceptive pills back-to-back can delay your period. Norethisterone is another option that can be taken a couple of days prior to your period starting until you wish to stop. 

It's essential to consult your gynecologist before taking any medication to delay your period. They will be able to advise you on the best option for your situation and ensure that it's safe for you to take.

Additionally, it's worth noting that stress can affect your menstrual cycle, so try to manage your stress levels as much as possible.

"['$435,000']",what is the minimum salary for an nfl rookie,"[""By Nick Kostora , Contributor Apr 8, 2013. The NFL's rookie wage scale is still in its relative infancy. Its inner workings can be difficult to understand, but with the NFL draft approaching and hundreds of fresh faces ready to enter the league, now is a great time to go behind the curtain.""
 'While the team would likely balk, they would have to explain to a player like 25 year-old Cam Newton that they will not guarantee his salary when he is 29 or 30 years old. It will take one of these highly leveraged players to break the seal on fully guaranteed contracts.'
 ""The 2016 cap is $155.27 million, and the rookie pool is split among the 32 teams. The latest projections at Over The Cap have a little over $5 million available for the 2016 salary of Thursday’s No. 1 pick. Yearly salaries, including bonuses, can’t increase by more than 25 percent on a player's rookie contract. The minimum salary for a first-year player is $450,000. Prior to the 2011 collective bargaining agreement, there was no limit to what rookies could make. After being taken first overall by the then-St.""
 'While the prior system had a limit on total rookie compensation, it was up to the team to determine how to allocate the Entering Player Pool, as it was called. In practice, first-round picks ended up receiving 55-60% of the pool, leaving the other 40-45% to divvy up among the rest of the team’s selections.'
 'Winston is on the high end of the spectrum. While most rookies still earn far more than most Americans, most aren’t necessarily making life-changing money. Still, the 2015 league minimum pays NFL players $435,000 in their rookie season. The average salary for a teacher in Florida is $47,780. Only 20 players on the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots made at least $1 million last season, meaning more than half the roster earned less than a seven-figure salary.'
 'Easy Math for Rookies. Simplifying the contracts of first-year players has had unintended consequences, especially for agents. There is perhaps no area in the business of football that has changed more from the 2011 collective bargaining agreement than rookie compensation. Slashing the pay of incoming players, who had no voice in the CBA negotiations, was an easy item on the collective bargaining checklist.'
 'Okay, now here is where things can get a little tricky. A few slides ago we talked about the salaries and contract lengths for Redskins rookies last season. Each had a four-year deal, but Robert Griffin III signed a deal worth more than $21 million while everyone else hovered around $2 million.'
 'Salaries were steadily rising before the implementation of the rookie wage scale, resulting in monster contracts for quarterbacks like Stafford and Bradford. After the wage scale took effect, Newton was the first to feel its wrath, as he signed a deal more than $50 million cheaper than those two signal-callers.'
 'The most prominent NFL rookie who has become flush with riches is quarterback Jameis Winston. The brash former Heisman Trophy winner was the No. 1 overall selection in April’s NFL Draft, signing a four-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers worth $23.35 million, $16.7 million of which is guaranteed.'
<<<<<<< HEAD
 'As part of the rookie wage scale, every rookie signs a four-year contract. The value of these contracts obviously varies, but the length does not. There is a difference of over $18 million between RG3 and everyone else, but each will be a Redskin for four seasons.']","According to the provided context, the minimum salary for an NFL rookie is $450,000.",0,

['It is a device that measures the amount of electrical friction generated as electrons pass through an electrical conductor.'],what is ohmmeter,"['Select a 10,000 ohm (10 kΩ) resistor from your parts assortment. This resistance value is indicated by a series of color bands: Brown, Black, Orange, and then another color representing the precision of the resistor, Gold (+/- 5%) or Silver (+/- 10%).'
 'Ohmmeter, instrument for measuring electrical resistance, which is expressed in ohms. In the simplest ohmmeters, the resistance to be measured may be connected to the instrument in parallel or in series. If in parallel (parallel ohmmeter), the instrument will draw more current as resistance increases. If in series (series ohmmeter), current will decrease as resistance rises.'
 'Megohmmeter (sometimes referred to as a megger) is a special type of ohmmeter used to measure the electrical resistance of insulators. Insulating components, for example cable jackets, must be tested for their insulation strength at the time of commissioning and as part of maintenance of high voltage electrical equipment and installations.'
 'Set your multimeter to the highest resistance range available. The resistance function is usually denoted by the unit symbol for resistance: the Greek letter omega (ω), or sometimes by the word “ohms.” Touch the two test probes of your meter together. When you do, the meter should register 0 ohms of resistance.'
 'On the other hand, if there is no resistance, an ohmmeter will give a reading of zero. However, if resistance was expected, then this reading indicates that there is a short in the unit being tested. While the earliest devices used only two leads, the next generation consisted of four.'
 'For this purpose megohmmeters, which can provide high DC voltages (typically in ranges from 500 V to 5 kV, some are up to 15 kV) at specified current capacity, are used. Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced.'
 'Welcome to Ohmmeter. The place for getting information on electrical resistance. No matter what the current, amps, or ohms, we can supply you with the equipment you need - including amp meters, ohmmeters, voltage regulators and voltmeters. Micro-ohmmeters make low resistance measurements and megohmmeters measure large values of resistance. The unit of measurement for resistance is ohms (ω).'
 ""A multimeter, which can be used to measure ohms. Ohmmeters can measure the resistance of carbon resistors. Ohm's Law is named for 19th century German physicist Georg Ohm.""

 'In fact, some estimates suggest that giardia infects up to 20% of the world’s population! A hard outer shell allows giardia to survive in the wide world, but it is most at home in the great indoors of the human and animal intestine. Nevertheless, as victims of circumstance, giardia parasites can find themselves expelled from the intestinal paradise by the usual route.'
 '1 Albendazole is effective against Giardia but is not safe in dogs and cats and should not be used. 2  Fenbendazole (50 mg/kg SID for 3 to 5 days) is effective in eliminating Giardia infection in dogs.'
 '1 Cysts are acquired from fecal-contaminated water, food, or fomites or through self-grooming. 2  Dog strains are not known to infect cats, and cat strains are not known to infect dogs. 3  Human infections are primarily acquired from other humans; transmission from dogs and cats to humans appears to be rare.'
 '1 Yeast may be mistaken for Giardia cysts due to their similar size and shape; however, yeast often show evidence of budding and do not have the internal structures seen in Giardia (i.e., median bodies, two to four nuclei). 2  Dogs and cats may have subclinical infections and show no signs of disease.'
 'The giardia organism inhabits the digestive tract of a wide variety of domestic and wild animal species, as well as humans. It is the most common pathogenic parasitic infection in humans worldwide; in 2013, there were about 280 million people worldwide with symptomatic giardiasis.'
 'Symptoms include weakness in the body, loss of appetite, diarrhea, loose or watery stools, stomach cramps, upset stomach, projectile vomiting (uncommon), bloating, excessive gas, and burping (often sulfurous). Symptoms typically develop 9–15 days after exposure, but may occur as early as one day. Symptoms are caused by Giardia organisms infecting the cells of the duodenum and jejunum of the small intestine and blocking nutrient absorption. Most people are asymptomatic; only about a third of infected people exhibit symptoms. If the infection is not treated, these symptoms may last for six weeks or more.']","According to the provided context, Giardia is often acquired through:

In fact, an image of three feathers were made into signet rings - each feather symbolizing Charity, hope, and faith.

 'If you’ve been worrying a lot lately, use the appearance of a white feather as a sign you should take time out to calm down and relax. After all, worrying does not take away tomorrow’s troubles, it takes away today’s peace. Everything is going to be okay.

Sometimes we can find ourselves feeling overwhelmed or stressed out by things that, in the grand scheme of things, don’t matter.'

In dreams feathers mean travel or the ability to move more freely in life. White feathers in dreams indicate innocence or a fresh start in a spiritual sense.'

 'Black and white mixed feathers can represent protection, or the sense of union. Black mixed with purple represents a very deep spirituality. I would take it as a mystical sign. Black, white, and blue mixed feathers denote change on the horizon. Brown and black striped pattern (like a pheasant/s feather) – balance between the physical and the spiritual.'

['Ruud'],who invented electric water boiler,"['Water heating is a thermodynamic process that uses an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature. Typical domestic uses of hot water include cooking, cleaning, bathing, and space heating.'
 'In industry, hot water and water heated to steam have many uses. Domestically, water is traditionally heated in vessels known as water heaters, kettles, cauldrons, pots, or coppers. These metal vessels that heat a batch of water do not produce a continual supply of heated water at a preset temperature. Rarely, hot water occurs naturally, usually from natural hot springs.'
 'Also, in most areas, low off-peak electric rates, versatile fuel selection, and the low initial cost make this the best option for your heating dollar. Electro Boilers are the ideal solution for under floor Radiant Heat and Hydronic Baseboard systems. Radiant Floor Heat has become the heat of choice in new construction because of its comfort, even heat distribution, and storage capability. These boilers are designed to protect your tubing from an overheat condition.'
 'These units were first introduced in 1981 and today represent the “standard of the industry” in most Upper Midwest states. Electro Industries is the only manufacturer providing design and package configurations for each of the following unique hot water heating applications: With WarmFlo Technology, WarmFlo Electric Boilers have become the most universal electric boiler on the market.'
 'Electricity is used in some space heaters directly to create heat by resistance. Electric current is passed thru a coiled wire or long metal ribbon made of a metal with a high … resistance. Resistance is to electricity as friction is to movement. Rub your hands together, and they heat up from friction.'
 'In traditional plumbing in the UK, the space-heating boiler is set up to heat a separate hot water cylinder or water heater for potable hot water. Such water heaters are often fitted with an auxiliary electrical immersion heater for use if the boiler is out of action for a time.'
 ""However, electric water heaters are considered continuous loads. This means you can't load it's circuit more than 80%. So a 4500 watt heater circuit must be sized up to either a 25 amp or 30 amp circuit. This means that #10 copper wire will also be used.""
 'Electricity is know … n to date back to the 6th century BC with a greek names Thales experimented it first by rubbing a fur and discovering that it would attract objects together. In Italy during the period of renaissance, a physicist Girolamo Cardano had discovered magnetism and electrical power.'
 'Ruud who invented the electric water heater (automatic storage) in 1889, founded the Ruud Manufacturing Company, which is still in operation today, and pioneered the advancement of water heaters, in both the residential and commercial market.

However, it's essential to note that even with bonding, the tooth is not fixed on a permanent basis, and it can still chip or crack if you eat hard food, for instance.

['Color tint of white light'],what does led color temperature mean,"[""It's important to keep in mind that even tho' reddish light has a technically lower color temperature, its frequently described as warm. Bluish light, which has a higher color temperature, is described as cool.""
 'Back to FAQ overview. Color temperature defines the color appearance of a white LED. CCT is defined in degrees Kelvin; a warm light is around 2700K, moving to neutral white at around 4000K, and to cool white, at 5000K or more. Note that CCT does not tell you anything about the color rendering ability of the LED.'
 'A light bulb that produces light perceived as yellowish white will have a color temperature of around 2700K. As the color temperature increases to 3000K - 3500K, the color of the light appears less yellow and more white. When the color temperature is 5000K or higher the light produced appears bluish white. The color temperature of daylight varies, but is often in the 5000K to 7000K range.'
 'In this instance, warmer & cooler describe color, not temperature. The greenish color of 4500°K fluorescent would not appear in a true Color Temperature chart because a fluorescent lamp does not get its color by heating a black body object to the point of glowing, it uses gases & phosphors instead.'
 ""Light sources that are not incandescent radiators have what is referred to as a Correlated Color Temperature (CCT). It's connotations to any part of the color temperature chart are strictly visually based.""
 'So a high colour temperature actually indicates a more “cool” colour, not a “warm” colour. In other words the term “cool” does not mean “low colour temperature”, it means “cool looking, like blue water or ice”. Artists were never very good at physics…. Enter optional CSS classes to be used for this module.'
 'For example, on a very bright day, the color temperature of the light may be as high as 8,000 or 10,000K, but we do not perceive that we are bathing in blue light, although the light from the blue sky is the predominant source.'
 'Color temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). The color temperature of a lamp (bulb) describes how the light appears when the human eye looks directly at the illuminated bulb. Color temperature is measured by a unit called the Kelvin (K). The Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale is defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins (K). (Note: The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is −273.15 °C or −459.67 °F).'
 ""Therefore, if an object is dependent upon light for color, color must be a property of light. And so it is.. Color temperature has been described most simply as a method of describing the color characteristics of light, usually either warm (yellowish) or cool (bluish), and measuring it in degrees of Kelvin (°K). That's a little too simple to be of more than introductory value.""
 'The “colour temperature” of a white light, whether LED or not, indicates the colour tint of the white light. Most white light is not pure white, it’s usually got a bit of a tint. In other words, there are different shades of white. “Warm white” generally means a yellow-ish type of white, and “cool white” means a blue-ish kind of white.']","According to the provided context, LED color temperature refers to the color appearance of a white LED.

['A shot of straight tequila blanco.'],what is a sangrita,"[""(June 2012). Sangrita (meaning little blood), whose origin dates back to the 1920s, is a customary partner to a shot of straight tequila blanco; a non-alcoholic accompaniment that highlights tequila's crisp acidity and cleanses the palate between each peppery sip.n essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice.""
 'Sangrita is traditionally blended using tomatoes, or tomato juice, orange juice, fresh lime juice, onions, salt and hot chili peppers. Born in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, sangrita was created to quench the fire of homemade tequila and quickly became a Mexican tradition.Typically used as a tequila chaser, mixer, or co-sip, sangrita allows the person to appreciate the premium tequila while sipping alternately from each of the glasses.angrita El Jimador is very popular because of its exclusive formula and is acceptable for all palates.

 ""The key to a balanced sangrita recipe can be found in the fruit salad's recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama. Traditionally, sangrita is served with tequila blanco, but it can also accompany tequila reposado.The tequila and sangrita are each poured into a separate shot glass (or caballito) and the two are alternately sipped, not chased.n essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained.

['Free Fall'],which term describes motion without air resistance to gravity?,"[""It says that the mass of an object times its acceleration is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it. There are now two forces, gravity and air resistance. The force of gravity is the weight of the object: 9.8 * mass, directed downward. Air resistance can be handled in several ways; we choose the simplest. Assume the force of air resistance is proportional to velocity and in the opposite direction: k * velocity, where k is a negative constant. Differential Equation: Remember, mass * acceleration = gravity + air resistance. m*v'(t) = -9.8*m + k*v(t) In practice, k is determined by the size and shape of the object.""
 ""The drag force depends on the square of the velocity. So as the body accelerates its velocity and the drag increase. It quickly reaches a point where the drag is exactly equal to the weight. When drag is equal to weight, there is no net external force on the object, and the acceleration becomes zero. The object then falls at a constant velocity as described by Newton's first law of motion.""
 'All objects accelerate at the same rate regardless of their masses. Acceleration due to earths gravity is 9.8m/s/s or 9.8m/s2. The term elapsed time refers to the amount of time that has passed since the object was dropped. Air resistance is assumed to be zero.'
 'Free Fall: Objectives: 1. Describe the motion of an object in free fall. 2. Describe the motion of an object thrown up and allowed to fall until it hits the ground. 3. Determine the speed and distance of an object at any time during free fall assuming that air resistance is negligible. 4. Explain why the acceleration of an object in free fall does not depend on the mass of the object.'
 ""Rule: Without air resistance and near the earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is a constant 9.8 meters per second per second directed downward. Differential Equation: This translates the rule into mathematical notation.""
 'The first force is the gravitational force, expressed as the weight of the object, and the second force is the aerodynamic drag of the object. the value of g is 9.8 meters per square second on the surface of the earth.'

Worst-case analysis (also called tolerance stack-up analysis) can be used to validate a design.'
 'presents tolerance stack up analysis of dimensional and geometrical tolerances. The stack up of tolerances is important for functionality of the mechanical. assembly as well as optimizing the cost of the system. Many industries are aware. of the importance of geometrical dimensioning & Tolerancing (GDT) of their. product design. Conventional methods of tolerance stack up analysis are tedious.'
 'Tolerance build-up in assemblies may then be predicted by tolerance analysis. The basis of tolerance analysis in design is an analytical model for the accumulation of tolerances in a mechanical assembly of component parts. The two most common models used in engineering design are briefly defined below.'
 'Tolerances should not be used with hesitation. Just because a larger tolerance band is used, it doesn’t mean parts will be sloppily made. In fact, depending on the manufacturer’s standards, shipped parts might have even tighter tolerances than originally specified. One good example is the bore of a gear.'
 'If the analysis involves part dimensions that are not parallel to the assembly measurement being studied, the stack-up approach must be modified since 2D variation such as angles, or any variation that is not parallel with the 1D direction, does not affect the assembly measurement with a 1-to-1 ratio.'
 'Product manufacturers utilize an organized flow of information to translate customer requirements into product requirements. This process for mechanical requirements is generalized in the flow diagram below. Tolerance Stack-Ups are vital to address mechanical fit and mechanical performance requirements.'
 'Automation of. stack up of geometrical tolerances can be used for tolerance allocation on the. components as well as their assemblies considering the functionality of the system. Stack of geometrical tolerances has been performed for individual components as. well as assembly of these components.'
 'Agenda:-. DimXpert for parts is a set of tools you use to apply dimensions and tolerances to parts according to the requirements of ASME Y14.41-2003 and ISO 16792:2006. You can then use the tolerances with TolAnalyst to perform “worst-case” tolerance stack-up analysis on assemblies. Log In.'
 'Tolerance analysis is a valuable tool for reducing manufacturing costs by improving producibility. Several useful methods of selecting design tolerances are presented with examples. The common and more advanced tolerance analysis methods are also reviewed and evaluated.'
 'Be careful when applying tolerances to a radius or diameter. A tolerance on a radius will double when measured as a diameter. A tolerance on a radius might be looser than intended, while one on a diameter might be tighter than intended. The effect of this is illustrated in the two gear drawings.']","Based on the provided context, it seems that you are referring to tolerance stack-up analysis in the context of mechanical assemblies. 

Performing a tolerance stack-up analysis is important because it helps to predict the accumulation of tolerances in a mechanical assembly, which is crucial for ensuring the functionality and performance of the assembly. This analysis is particularly important in industries where precision and accuracy are critical, such as in the manufacturing of mechanical components, gears, and other mechanical systems.

By performing a tolerance stack-up analysis, designers and engineers can identify potential issues with the assembly's fit and performance, and make adjustments to the design or manufacturing process to ensure that the assembly meets the required specifications. This can help to reduce the risk of defects, improve product quality, and minimize the need for costly rework or repairs.

In the context of the provided text, it seems that the authors are emphasizing the importance of tolerance stack-up analysis in mechanical design, particularly in the context of geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing (GDT). They highlight the need for a systematic approach to tolerance analysis, using analytical models to predict the accumulation of tolerances in a mechanical assembly.

Prednisolone may also be given in low doses to assist in controlling asthma. The common dosage is usually one tablet a day for two weeks, and it is usually recommended to take this medication with food.'
 'Hi Wednesday :) I was on Pred one time, for almost 8 months.. I was on 50mg and BOY O BOY, did I get moon face... and moon back, moon neck, and about 30 extra pounds.. UGH... Anyhow, for me, I started noticing the puffiness going away at around 15mg or so..'
 'Answers (2) the half life is roughly 4 hours. The prednisone should be tapered slowly and never stopped abruptly if you have been on it for over 2 weeks and were are a high dose. if you took it for 2-3 days you should be fine. The higher the dose and the longer you are on the drug the slower the taper.']","Based on the provided context, it seems that the elimination half-life of prednisone is around 3-4 hours. This means that the body reduces the plasma levels of prednisone by half every 3-4 hours.

According to the context, it usually takes around 5.5 half-lives for a drug to be completely eliminated from the system. Since the half-life is 3-4 hours, it would take around 16.25 to 22 hours for prednisone to be completely eliminated from the system.

However, it's important to note that the therapeutic effects of prednisone can last longer than the elimination half-life. The therapeutic effects of prednisone can last for several days, although the side effects may wane over several days.

It's also important to note that the body converts prednisone into prednisolone, which also has steroid effects. The plasma half-life of prednisolone is 2-3 hours, which means that the effects of prednisolone can last for around 4-6 hours.

Putting greens in warm climates are most apt to be Bermudagrass. If you want to improve your putting game by having a green in your backyard, you have several varieties to choose from depending on where you live. If you live in a warmer climate, a hybrid cultivar of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) is your best bet.'
 'Bermuda grass is a major turf species for golf courses. In the United States, the distribution of Bermuda grass extends from New Jersey and Maryland southward to Florida, and westward to Kansas and Texas. Modern irrigation extends Bermuda grass use westward to southern New Mexico, Arizona and California.'
 'Northern cooler climates are best suited for grasses such as Bentgrass, fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, Poa annua, and Poa trivialis. Many golf courses have a mix of these types, for each one has advantages and disadvantage. For example, St. Andrews in Scotland has most of these types of grass.'
 'Turf Grass for Golf Courses. Recommended for golf course greens, fairways, tees, roughs, athletic fields, and sports venues, SeaStar is a new and improved Seashore Paspalum and was the top rated line for turf quality, color and texture at eight trial locations.'

Your location greatly affects which type of turf grass is best suited for your facility. Therefore, for this discussion, we will categorize turf grass types for different climate zones.'

 'How can the grass on the greens at a golf course be so perfect? Golf greens need plenty of sunflight and good airflow. If you have ever really looked at the grass on a well-maintained golf green, it is absolutely amazing--it is a flawless surface made out of plants! To make it this perfect takes a lot of work. The work starts by creating what is practically a hydroponic system for growing the grass.'

It is earned after flying 75,000 Medallion Qualification Miles or racking up 100 Medallion Qualification Segments.'
 'General SkyMiles membership. 2 miles per dollar spent on Delta purchases (that adds up to a minimum of 7 miles per dollar spent on Delta flights – 5 miles from a general SkyMiles membership, 2 miles from the card; you can earn more as a Medallion member) 1 mile per dollar spent on all other purchases.'
 'Delta has now revealed their end of the year promotion for buying up to status. Through December 31, 2015, you can purchase up to 10,000 MQMs to help get you to the next elite tier. Here are the details:'

 'The other two are not officially published by AA -- the easier of the two is what is known as the Gold Challenge. For a fee of about $100, you can be eligible for a shortcut to Gold status that requires the earning of 5,000 elite qualifying points (not miles, as klatu80 incorrectly notes) within 90 days.'
 'If you go on a lot of short flights, you may meet the MQSs requirement faster, and if you go on long flights, you may meet the MQMs requirement faster. General membership brings home 5 miles per dollar spent on Delta flights; for Silver Medallion status, it’s 7; for Gold Medallion, 8. You’ll also earn 9 miles per dollar with Platinum Medallion status and 11 miles per dollar with the highest status, Diamond Medallion.'

In this case, the U.S. House of Representatives would break that deadlock, with members of each state casting a single vote. A majority wins. In the case of Bush/Cheney, it never got that far.'
 'Presidents of the United States with 90+ answers. There is no specific limit on the pardon authority, and as no President (or Governor with pardon power, so far as I know) has ever attempted to pardon himself or herself, the question has never been adjudicated.'
 'Being convicted of a felony is not a disqualification for the office of President, so even if convicted the President (or President-Elect) could continue to hold (or assume) office.'
 'In many of his activities, he is indeed above the law, not just because lawsuits might be inconvenient to the commander-in-chief, but because the presidency is a separate branch of government protected by the Constitution from being overly impaired in its functions by individuals or by the judiciary.'
 'Note also that the sitting President has the unquestionable power to prevent his or her own prosecution, as he can simply order the Attorney General to not pursue the prosecution or to drop the charges, and he can also order the Attorney General to fail to enforce any sentence imposed.'
 ""Let's use the Bush/Rubio hypothetical. Bush could choose Rubio to be his running mate. And if the two won, Florida's 29 electors could vote to make Bush president, but not to make Rubio vice president (or vice versa).""

 'The Constitution provides no exemption for the presidency from the legal processes of other branches. Congress alone is blessed with such a protection, but that shield, the Speech or Debate Clause, is strictly limited to legislative functions.'
 ""I'm not sure a President's ability to pardon covers state convictions and state laws. But what would be likely to happen is, if a President Elect commits a crime after the election but before the inauguration, they would be pressured to resign and allow the Vice-President Elect to assume the office.""]","According to the context provided, the Constitution does not explicitly ban indicting a sitting President. However, it does provide some protections for the President, such as the power to pardon and the ability to prevent prosecution through executive action. The Constitution also grants the President immunity from prosecution while in office, but this immunity is not absolute and can be waived by the President.

It's worth noting that the Constitution does not explicitly address the issue of indicting a sitting President, and the question of whether a President can be indicted while in office has been the subject of much debate and controversy. Some argue that the Constitution prohibits the indictment of a sitting President, while others argue that it does not.

In the context of the provided text, it is stated that ""the Constitution provides no exemption for the presidency from the legal processes of other branches. Congress alone is blessed with such a protection, but that shield, the Speech or Debate Clause, is strictly limited to legislative functions.""

"['$118,500']",how much have i paid into social security,"['4But since 2010, Social Security’s cash expenses have exceeded its cash receipts. Negative cash flow last year was about $74 billion, according to the latest trustees’ report, and this year the gap is projected to be around $84 billion.'
 'In June 2011, the average Social Security benefit was $1,180.80 per month. The maximum possible benefit for a worker retiring at age 66 in 2011 is $2,366. But to get this amount, the worker would need to earn the maximum taxable amount, currently $106,800, each year after age 21.'
 'Your benefit amount is based on your earnings history and age at retirement, not on how much you and your employer paid in Social Security taxes (although for most people, taxes paid are closely tied to their earnings). 3Right now, Social Security has plenty of assets.'
 'His employer pays an identical amount. Jane pays $7,049 for Social Security (6.2 percent of the 2013 maximum wage base of $113,700) and $1,740 for Medicare (1.45 percent of $120,000 salary), for a total of $8,789 for 2013.'
 'Workers and employers pay for Social Security. Workers pay 6.2 percent of their earnings up to a cap, which is $118,500 a year in 2015. (The cap on taxable earnings usually rises each year with average wages.) Employers pay a matching amount for a combined contribution of 12.4 percent of earnings.'
 'But this rule only applies if your total earnings. are more than $118,500. For example, if you. will have $30,000 in wages and $40,000 in self-. employment income in 2016, you will pay the. appropriate Social Security taxes on both your. wages and business earnings.'
 '1Social Security touches more people than just about any other federal program. At the end of 2014, according to the most recent trustees’ report, some 59 million Americans were receiving retirement, disability or survivors’ benefits from the system; the total cost was $848.5 billion.'
 ""Social Security benefits are calculated based on your 35 highest-earning years in the workforce, and are adjusted for inflation. If you don't have 35 years of earnings, zeros are averaged in for the years you didn't work at a job in which you paid into Social Security. The proportion of your income that is replaced by Social Security varies based on how much you earn. Consider a worker who turns 62 in 2011. To calculate his benefit, the first $749 of his average monthly earnings is multiplied by 90 percent, the next $3,768 by 32 percent, and the remainder by 15 percent.""
 ""In 2013 the average worker made $44,888 a year, according to the Social Security Administration. This worker and his or her employer will each pay $2,783 this year. Approximately 6 percent of all workers will earn more than the $118,500 tax cap. Earnings above the cap now account for 17 percent of the aggregate pay of all workers who pay into Social Security. An additional tax on workers' earnings pays for Medicare hospital insurance. This is a 1.45 percent levy, paid by workers and employers each on all wages, for a total tax of 2.9 percent.""
 '2Social Security is, and always has been, an inter-generational transfer of wealth.

['Removal of Red Blood Cells and spleen of an adult holds the largest amount of lymphoid tissue.'],what are the three functions of the spleen,"['Removal of Red Blood Cells. One of the functions of the spleen is to remove any old red blood cells, according to Kim Barrett, professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego, writing in “Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology.” The normal lifespan of a red blood cell is 120 days.'
 'Figure 1 | Structure of the spleen. a | Schema of the spleen. The afferent splenic artery branches into central arterioles, which are sheathed by white-pulp areas; these white-pulp areas consist of the T-cell zone (also known as the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, PALS), arterioles and B-cell follicles.'
 'Lymphocytes are concentrated in the lymph nodes. The spleen and the thymus are also lymphoid organs of the immune system. The tonsils are lymphoid organs that are also associated with the digestive system. Lymphoid tissues contain lymphocytes, and also contain other types of cells for support.'
 'Overview. The lymphatic system has the responsibility of keeping you alive and healthy. The spleen, which is in the upper left abdominal area, is one of the organs in this system. The spleen of an adult holds the largest amount of lymphoid tissue. An adult spleen is about 5 inches long and weighs approximately 4 oz.'
 'So, the concentration of MINT can determine the cell fate of mature B cells in the spleen.In a similar manner, the levels of the helix–loop–helix tran scription factor E2A and its antagonist ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) can determine the cell fate of mature B cells 91.'
 'Yuan-Source points are the sites where the Yuan (Primary) qi of the Zang-Fu organs passes and stays. Puncturing the Yuan-Source points stimulates the vital energy of the regular meridians, regulates the functional activities of the internal organs, reinforces antipathogenic factors and eliminates pathogenic factors.'
 'Lymphocytes and dendritic cells can enter the white pulp from the marginal sinus by passing through a layer of sinus-lining cells that form a barrier between the marginal zone and the white pulp. These sinus-lining cells express mucosal vascular addressin cell-adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1).'
 'Location: On the medial aspect of the foot, in the depression posterior and inferior to the proximal metatarsodigital joint of the big toe, at the junction of the red and white skin. Classification: Yuan-Source point of the Spleen Meridian. Shu-Stream point of the Spleen Meridian. Indications: 1  Gastric pain, abdominal distention and pain, diarrhea, dysentery. 2  Lassitude and heaviness of the extremities, overweight (for dampness in all three jiaos). 3  Epigastric pain.'
 'Roughly 17 litres of the filtered plasma are reabsorbed directly into the blood vessels, while the remaining three litres remain in the interstitial fluid. One of the main functions of the lymph system is to provide an accessory return route to the blood for the surplus three litres. The other main function is that of defense in the immune system. Lymph is very similar to blood plasma: it contains lymphocytes and other white blood cells.'
 'Located in the abdomen, directly beneath the dia-phragm, and connected to the stomach, the spleen is the body’s largest filter of the blood 1,2. In essence, the spleen is organized as a ‘tree’ of branching arterial vessels, in which the smaller arterioles end in a VENOUS SINUSOIDAL SYSTEM.']","According to the provided context, the three functions of the spleen are:

1. Removal of old red blood cells: The spleen removes old or damaged red blood cells from the circulation, which helps to maintain the overall health of the blood.
2. Filtering of the blood: The spleen acts as a filter for the blood, removing pathogens, damaged cells, and other foreign substances from the circulation.
3. Storage of red blood cells: The spleen stores red blood cells, releasing them into the circulation as needed to help maintain healthy blood levels.

 'The first Early Anthropocene proposal was advanced by U.S. geologist William Ruddiman, who argues that the Anthropocene started when humans began large-scale agriculture in various parts of the world between eight and five thousand years ago.'
 ""Geologic time. The geological time scale (GTS) is a system of chronological measurement that relates stratigraphy to time, and is used by geologists, paleontologists, and other Earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred throughout Earth's history.""
 'What Is the Anthropocene and Are We in It? Efforts to label the human epoch have ignited a scientific debate between geologists and environmentalists (Illustration by Stephanie Dalton Cowan)'
 'Some Anthropocene proponents concede that difficulty. But don’t get bogged down in the mud, they say, just stipulate a date and move on. Will Steffen, who heads Australia National University’s Climate Change Institute and has written articles with Crutzen, recommends starting the epoch with the advent of the industrial revolution in the early 1800s or with the atomic age in the 1950s.'
 'This measure would put the beginning of the Anthropocene around the middle of the 20th century. Humanity Leaving Its Mark. It’s important to remember that the beginning of the Anthropocene does not correspond the first measurable indications of human activity. Rather, it is the first point at which human activity shows up in the stratigraphic record.'
 ""The conference chairman kept referring to the Holocene, the epoch that began at the end of the last ice age, 11,500 years ago, and that—officially, at least—continues to this day. 'Let's stop it,' Crutzen recalls blurting out. 'We are no longer in the Holocene. We are in the Anthropocene.' Well, it was quiet in the room for a while.""
 '-Anthropocene greenhouse gas emission began 8,000 years ago with intensive farming -gradual amount of GHGs has been added up in total to be more than our industrial revolution; over time, build up is more of a driver of climate change than recent emissions (with over 350,000 years of data --> 8,000 year patterns stopped being so consistent)'
 'The word combines the root anthropo, meaning human with the root -cene, the standard suffix for epoch in geologic time. The Anthropocene is distinguished as a new period either after or within the Holocene, the current epoch, which began approximately 10,000 years ago (about 8000 BC) with the end of the last glacial period.'
 'If the Anthropocene is a period, then the Quaternary period, which began approximately 2.6 million years ago at a time of major glacial-interglacial fluctuation, has ended. If it is an epoch, then the Holocene epoch – the interglacial (warm) interval that began 11,800 years ago – has ended.']","According to the context, there is no consensus on the exact date of the beginning of the Anthropocene epoch. However, some proponents suggest that it started:

* With the advent of the industrial revolution in the early 1800s (Will Steffen)
* With the atomic age in the 1950s (Will Steffen)
* With the beginning of large-scale agriculture between 8,000 and 5,000 years ago (William Ruddiman)

The context also mentions that the Anthropocene is distinguished as a new period either after or within the Holocene, which began approximately 10,000 years ago with the end of the last glacial period.

['No Answer Present.'],diet for autoimmune diseases,"['Genetic predisposition to autoimmunity makes up about one third of your risk of developing an autoimmune disease. The other two thirds of your risk come from environmental factors, which include: diet, lifestyle, infections (both prior and persistent) exposure to toxins, hormones, weight, etc.'
 'The Best Diet For Autoimmune Disease. 6/11/2013 | BY Mickey Trescott. I wanted to address something that has come up a lot lately. People stumble across this site as a result of a link or a Google search for natural ways to manage their autoimmune condition.'
 'Technically, an autoimmune disease cannot be “cured”, but in many cases, it is possible to put the condition into remission with careful diet and lifestyle changes. I switched to an autoimmune protocol diet after being diagnosed with Hashimotos in hopes of giving my immune system a little time to recover.'
 'If you have general, lingering symptoms, you may be suffering from an autoimmune disease -- which means your immune system is attacking healthy tissue. Your first symptoms of an autoimmune disease may be general, such as fatigue, low-grade fever, and difficulty concentrating, making autoimmune diseases difficult to diagnose at first. You also may feel depressed and consult a doctor for that.'
 'Following a healthy diet plan free of foods a person is sensitive to allows for the body to decrease the total number of antibodies produced, providing some relief to the body. There is a lot of research that suggests a vegetarian diet for people with autoimmune diseases. While we recognize this research may point someone in the right direction, Diet Typing is still ideal to take a more specific snapshot of the person’s physiology.'
 'If you have an autoimmune disease and are looking for a way of eating that will best enable your body to heal, the autoimmune protocol is a great place to start. I encourage you to do your research thoroughly, and don’t forget to make the process your own.'
 'Even with a genetic tendency, a person may not develop an autoimmune disease without an environmental influence to set it off. Examples of these are infections, certain foods (iodine or gluten products), and toxins (some drugs, smoking, certain hair dyes, chemicals in the workplace).'
 'The Specifics of the Autoimmune Diet. The general idea of the autoimmune diet is that you are removing any potentially inflammatory foods, but the specifics are a bit more difficult. Some sources consider foods like fruit and sweet potatoes ok, while others do not.'
 'The Hauser Diet for Autoimmune Diseases. When an individual has an autoimmune disease, their immune system mistakenly turns against itself, targeting the cells, tissues and organs of their own body. Many different autoimmune diseases exist, each affecting the body in different ways.'
 'I am not advocating that anyone with an autoimmune disease give up these foods for a lifetime. Instead, I am trying to give you the tools that you need in order to implement a thorough elimination diet, so that you can find out for yourself where your gut is at and which foods are causing you trouble.']","Based on the provided context, it seems that a diet for autoimmune diseases involves removing potentially inflammatory foods and incorporating foods that can help alleviate symptoms. Some specific foods and drinks that have been shown to boost the immune system and help with autoimmune diseases include:

* Yoghurt
* Kefir
* Salmon and tuna
* Flaxseeds and walnuts
* Olive, canola, and walnut oil

Additionally, a vegetarian diet has been suggested as a potential option for people with autoimmune diseases. However, it's important to note that everyone's physiology is unique, and a more personalized approach may be necessary.

The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is also mentioned as a potential option for managing autoimmune diseases. This diet involves removing potentially inflammatory foods and incorporating foods that are easy to digest.

It's also important to note that while diet can play a significant role in managing autoimmune diseases, it's not the only factor. Environmental factors, such as infections, toxins, and lifestyle habits, can also contribute to the development and progression of autoimmune diseases.

Endothelial cells form the endocardium, the interior lining of blood vessels and cardiac valves. Smooth muscle cells contribute to the coronary arteries and inflow and outflow vasculature.'
 'Pacemaker cells and Purkinje fibres in the conduction system are specialized cardiomyocytes that generate and conduct electrical impulses. The sinoatrial node (SAN), which is composed of a group of pacemaker cells, resides in the right atrium generating impulses to initiate heart contraction. The atrioventricular node (AVN) is located between the atria and ventricles, and it conducts an electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. Mei Xin,'
 ""The Conduction System (illustration) Electrical impulses from your heart muscle (the myocardium) cause your heart to contract. This electrical signal begins in the sinoatrial (SA) node, located at the top of the right atrium. The SA node is sometimes called the heart's natural pacemaker.. An electrical impulse from this natural pacemaker travels through the muscle fibers of the atria and ventricles, causing them to contract.""
 'The upper chambers are called the left and right atria, and the lower chambers are called the left and right ventricles. A wall of muscle called the septum separates the left and right atria and the left and right ventricles. The left ventricle is the largest and strongest chamber in your heart.'
 ""It is noteworthy that only the cells within the bundle of His, left and right bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers satisfy all three criteria. No structure within the atria meets all three criteria, including the Bachmann's bundle, sinoatrial node, and atrioventricular node (which are all uninsulated tissues).""
 'In general, although it typically cannot be seen grossly, the location of the sinoatrial node is on the roof of the right atrium at the approximate junction of the superior vena cava, the right atrial appendage, and the sulcus terminalis.'
 'the bundle of his. a continuation of the AV node and located at the interventricular septum. it branches into the right bundle branch, which extends down the right side of the interventricular septum, and the left bundle branch, which extends into the left ventricle. the right and left bundle branches terminate into purkinje fibers.'
 'In general, the atrioventricular node is located in the so-called floor of the right atrium, over the muscular part of the interventricular septum, inferior to the membranous septum: i.e., within the triangle of Koch, which is bordered by the coronary sinus, the tricuspid valve annulus along the septal leaflet, and the tendon of Todaro (Figure 2).'
 'One of the most conspicuous features of sinoatrial nodal cells is that they possess poorly developed contractile apparati (a common feature to all myocytes specialized for conduction), comprising only about 50% of the intracellular volume [1,10,15].'

['No Answer Present.'],what to do when someone new is hired and you feel threatened,"['If you feel that you or your child has been threatened, there are number of different legal and strategic avenues you can take. First, you must rationally determine with an officer of the law whether the threat leveled against you or your child warrants legal action.'
 ""Step 1. Ask your supervisor or human resources to assign a company ambassador or work buddy to you in the first few weeks. This person's job is to show you the ropes, make personal introductions and help you navigate your new organization culture.""
 '“If you’re a manager and it’s someone on your own team who is moving for your job, the best thing to do is to embrace of the aspirations of that person,” says Carolyn Hughes, vice president of people at SimplyHired.com. “One part of your role as a manager is that you need to groom successors.”.'
 ""Affirm your child's feelings by repeating what he has said back to you—this will help him feel that you understand and will be able to offer real solutions for the problem. If the bully has not physically harmed or threatened your child, the best advice you can give him is to ignore his tormentor.""
 'Before taking brash action against a perceived threat, try to view the situation as an outsider would. If your boss scolded you for a real infraction of duty, he may simply be keeping everyone to the same standards to provide a consistent workplace environment.'
 'The more confident you are in your abilities the less threatened you will feel by the arrival of a newcomer to the workplace. As part of our MYOB Training Course, we’re constantly adding new content and helping our students win work and improve their employability.'
 ""If, during the complaint process, relations have not improved, or you feel like you're going to be the victim of backlash from your boss, it may be time to leave the company.""
 ""Contact the police. If you’re being harassed and you feel you're in danger you can contact the police. If you think you’re being harassed because of your disability, race, religion, transgender identity or sexual orientation, you can report the harassment to the police as a hate incident or crime.""
 'Look Inward. Before taking brash action against a perceived threat, try to view the situation as an outsider would. If your boss scolded you for a real infraction of duty, he may simply be keeping everyone to the same standards to provide a consistent workplace environment.'
 'Others might try to sink a co-worker’s career because they feel threatened. “It could be that they are intimidated by you and your talents,” Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says. “They may want your job outright, and making you look bad may allow them to get their foot in the door.”.']","When someone new is hired and you feel threatened, it's essential to take a step back and assess the situation objectively. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Rationally determine the threat**: Ask yourself if the new hire's presence is genuinely a threat to your job or if it's just a perceived threat. Consider the new hire's skills, experience, and role in the organization.
2. **Focus on your strengths**: Instead of worrying about the new hire, focus on your own strengths, skills, and accomplishments. This will help you feel more confident and secure in your position.
3. **Embrace the change**: View the new hire as an opportunity for growth and learning. You can learn from their experiences and perspectives, and they can learn from yours.
4. **Communicate with your supervisor**: If you're feeling threatened, consider speaking with your supervisor to express your concerns. They may be able to provide guidance or reassurance.
5. **Look inward**: Before taking any action, try to view the situation from an outsider's perspective. Ask yourself if your concerns are justified or if you're overreacting.

['A good source of dietary fiber.'],what are raisins a good source of?,"[""Grapes, on the other hand, have long been classified as a low glycemic index (GI) food, with GI values ranging between 43-53. In the case of grapes, recent studies have also shown that the low GI value of grapes is a good indicator of this fruit's blood sugar benefits.""
 'Raisins are dried grapes/currants. However, unlike fresh grapes, they indeed are rich and concentrated sources of energy, vitamins, electrolytes, and minerals. On weight per weight comparison basis, 100 g of dried grapes hold 249 calories, several times more fiber, vitamins, minerals and poly-phenol antioxidants than the fresh grapes.'
 'When we think of iron-rich foods, things such as red meat and liver usually come to mind. But raisins may be a better source of iron, particularly for people who eat little or no meat. Iron is essential for the creation of hemoglobin in red blood cells, which the body uses to transport oxygen.'
 'A quarter-cup of raisins has 0.8 milligram of iron, which is more than 8% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men and 5% of the RDA for women. Like other dried fruits, raisins also a good source of dietary fiber, with nearly 2 grams of fiber in ¼ cup.'
 'They are good source of potassium, a mineral that has been shown to lower high blood pressure. In one study, researchers at John Hopkins Medical Institution in. gave men either potassium supplements or blank pills.'
 'Raisins are made from dehydrating grapes in a process that either involves the heat of the sun or a mechanical process of oven drying. Among the most popular types of raisins are Sultana, Malaga, Monukka, Zante Currant, Muscat, and Thompson seedless.'
 ""The CDC recommends between 1.5-2.5 cups of fruit and 2.5-4.0 cups of vegetables per day, as well as a target goal of at least 5 fruit-plus-vegetable servings (combined) per day. We recommend that you set your fruit goals higher than these CDC amounts. Based on the scientific research, we believe it's going to take closer to 3 fruit servings per day (consisting of one cup's worth of fruit per serving, or 3 cups total per day) to provide you with optimum health benefits.""
 'The combination of unique texture and sweet, tart flavor has made grapes an ever popular between-meal snack as well as a refreshing addition to both fruit and vegetable salads. Grapes are small round or oval berries that feature semi-translucent flesh encased by a smooth skin.'
 'Raisins are dense sources of minerals like calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium copper, fluoride, and zinc. Copper and manganese are an essential co-factor of antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. 100 g provides 23% daily requirement levels of iron. In addition, they are rich in heart-healthy electrolyte, potassium.'
 'The main difference between them is the way they are dried. Black, or sun-dried raisins are actually dried in the sun. This is what gives them their dark, shriveled look. Golden seedless raisins are dried by exposing them to the fumes of burning sulfur in a closed chamber, which gives them their golden hue.']","According to the provided context, raisins are a good source of:

1. Iron: A quarter-cup of raisins has 0.8 milligram of iron, which is more than 8% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men and 5% of the RDA for women.

['Fluorocarbon rubbers are the most chemically resistant.'],what elastomers are the most chemically resistant,"['When searching for a chemical resistant o-ring, gasket, or seal, the most successful elastomers will be in the class of fluorocarbon rubbers. Several characteristics of fluorocarbon rubber tend to impart the characteristics necessary for chemical resistance, specifically, the ratio of fluorine to hydrogen,'
 'As a starting point, here is a quick list of DuPont chemical resistant elastomer and thermoplastic materials: 1  Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts: Resistance to over 1800 chemicals and temperatures to 327oC, available in both standard and custom parts.'
 '† Changes in elastomers due to low temperature. are physical, not chemical, and are generally. reversible. However, if the geometry of the gland. changes while the seal is cold, the seal may be too. stiff to adapt to the new shape and may fail. Movement may damage the seal while it is cold. and inflexible.'
 'The upper temperature limit of. elastomers in methanol service is determined by the chemical characteristics of the. elastomer relative to those of methanol. As operating temperature increases, chemically similar elastomers are affected more than elastomers that are chemically. dissimilar to methanol.'
 'DuPont chemical resistant elastomers and thermoplastics supply durable sealing and flexibility for demanding applications. From elastomers used in auto engine seals that can withstand new, emission-reducing fuels to parts used in oil and gas down-hole applications, DuPont has answers for today’s toughest challenges.'
 'Section 3. Elastomers/Materials. ■ Chemical Terms, Abbreviations, Trade Names . . . . ■ Polymer Types . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . •Acrylonitrile/Butadiene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-3.'
 'Kalrez® Perfluoroelastomer Parts: Highest Chemical Resistance. For the most demanding applications, DuPont™ Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer (FFKM) parts have the best fluid resistance of any elastomer. Kalrez® parts and seals resist over 1,800 different chemicals, while providing high temperature stability of PTFE (327°C).'
 'Polymers that are suitable for one. type of service (e.g., O-rings, gaskets, seals or packing) may not be suitable for any. another service in spite of the fact that they are exposed to the same chemical. Temperature and pressure are major determinates in selecting elastomers for a. particular service.'
 'Butyl is capable of providing high-. energy absorption (dampening) and good hot tear strength. Good resistance to heat, abrasion, oxygen, ozone and. sunlight are dependent upon the butyl polymer saturation. level. Butyl however, displays poor resistance to petroleum. oil, gasoline and hydrocarbon solvents.'

If you're looking for a natural remedy to help with sleep, I'd recommend exploring other options. Some natural sleep aids include:

* A warm bath or shower before bed
* Reading a book or listening to calming music
* Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation
* Avoiding screens and electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime
* Creating a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment

"['Yes,It is.']",is retrograde ejaculation,"['Retrograde ejaculation is typically not painful and is only noted by a decrease in the amount of semen that is produced during orgasm. Urine may also be cloudy after an orgasm. Many men elect not to seek treatment unless they are concerned about their fertility.'
 'URL of this page: //medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001282.htm. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder instead of going out through the urethra during ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation is uncommon. It most often occurs when the opening of the bladder (bladder neck) does not close. This causes semen to go backwards into the bladder rather than forwards out of the penis. Retrograde ejaculation may be caused by:'
 'Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in men where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body through the penis. Normally, when a man ejaculates, semen is propelled down through the urethra and out of the body. Retrograde ejaculation means that semen is propelled up the urethra, and moves backwards into the bladder. The semen later exits the body during urination.'
 'Retrograde ejaculation is a common side effect of medications, such as tamsulosin, that are used to relax the muscles of the urinary tract, treating conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. By relaxing the bladder sphincter muscle, the likelihood of retrograde ejaculation is increased.'
 'Retrograde ejaculation is sometimes referred to as a dry orgasm.. Retrograde ejaculation is one cause of male infertility. Men often notice during masturbation that they do not have semen release but there is an orgasm. Another underlying cause for this phenomenon may be ejaculatory duct obstruction.'
 '[edit on Wikidata] Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen, which would, in most cases, be ejaculated via the urethra, is redirected to the urinary bladder. Normally, the sphincter of the bladder contracts before ejaculation forcing the semen to exit via the urethra, the path of least resistance.'
 'This generally does not require treatment unless it impairs fertility. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate, or after certain abdominal operations.'
 'Your health care provider may recommend that you stop taking any medicines that may cause retrograde ejaculation. This can make the problem go away. Retrograde ejaculation that is caused by diabetes or surgery may be treated with drugs such as pseudoephedrine or imipramine.'
 'Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants, may affect ejaculation.'

['No Answer Present.'],when did portugal use brazil for sugar,"['For years, the Portuguese had trouble colonizing Brazil because nobody wanted to leave Europe and start a new life in a place that had nothing to offer (except the wealth that had already been taken away – such as pau-brasil, a Brazilian tree – or the ones which were to be discovered in 200 years, such as gold).'
 'By the beginning of the 19th century, Portugal controlled outposts at six locations in Africa. One was the Cape Verde Islands, located about 700 miles due west of Dakar, Senegal. Discovered by Alvise da Cadamosta of Venice in 1456 and claimed for Portugal by Diogo Gomes about 1458, this archipelago of eight major islands was devoted to sugar cultivation using slaves taken from the African mainland.'
 'Considering that the governors were in Brazil, the economic block favoring Portugal products was over, in an episode known as the opening of the ports to friendly nations - which practically ended the colonial pact and made the colony an independent nation until 1821, when Dom João returned to Portugal.'
 ""He never did, and in the meantime, Brazil suffered the consequences. Spain had, besides its own territory and Portugal’s as well, a lot of colonies to keep – their own plus Portugal's, so the large Brazilian coast remained unprotected and became a target for Spaniard enemies.""
 'Exploration and conquest began as an enterprise supported by the nobility, and Portuguese peasants rarely participated unless forced to do so. When the common people of Portugal did chose to emigrate, they were much more likely to head to Brazil than to Africa.'
 'In the process, they established forts and settlements along the West and East African coasts. In the 16th through 18th centuries, the Portuguese lost their lead to other European nations, notably England and France, but played a major role in the slave trade to satisfy the demand for labor in Brazil.'
 ""As the European conquest of Africa unfolded, Portugal played the role of catalyst rather than leader. Hampered by its small size and weakened by several centuries of European warfare, Portugal was the smallest and poorest of Europe's imperial powers by the end of the 19th century.""
 'Also by that time, Portugal created a series of laws, defined by a Colonial Pact, which established the Brazilian dependence to Portugal. It made Brazil purchase and sell products only from and to the metropolis and to some of its economic partners if Portugal allowed it.'
 'Brazil became the main sugar producer from 1580s on and, for almost a century, it was the largest producer and main character in European markets with its sugar, until the Dutch left the country, taking the sugarcane plants to their colonies in Central America.'

['Twenty'],how many amino acids in a protein,"['The problem with amino acids is that they deteriorate. The body will store extra starch and protein as fat, to use later. Amino acids are not stored, but they can be replaced. There are upwards of twenty different kinds of amino acids that form proteins. Some of these the body makes.'
 'A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20-30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues.'
 'Amino acids make up 75% of the human body, and are vital to every part of human function. One of the most talked about properties of amino acids is how it can assist in muscle building.'
 'The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.'
 'Arginine is a basic amino acid. Both base functions exist as onium conjugate acids in the pH 6.00 matrix. The solute molecules of arginine therefore carry an excess positive charge, and they move toward the cathode.'
 'Many unusual amino acids, including D-enantiomers of some common acids, are produced by microorganisms. These include ornithine, which is a component of the antibiotic bacitracin A, and statin, found as part of a pentapeptide that inhibits the action of the digestive enzyme pepsin.'
 'Meat, eggs, and dairy are the most common sources of these important building blocks. It can be difficult for strict vegetarians and vegans to get all their essential amino acids. Most vegetarian protein foods, such as beans and seeds, contain only portions of the essentials.'
 'Many other naturally occurring amino acids exist, and the structures of a few of these are displayed below. Some, such as hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline, are simply functionalized derivatives of a previously described compound. These two amino acids are found only in collagen, a common structural protein. Homoserine and homocysteine are higher homologs of their namesakes. The amino group in beta-alanine has moved to the end of the three-carbon chain.'
 'Foods with amino acids are the building blocks of protein. That means they are responsible for strength, repair and rebuilding inside your body. Your tissues, your cells, your enzymes and your brain all get their nourishment and protection from amino acids.'

When the kidneys are working as they should, there may be a very small amount of albumin in the urine. But when the kidneys are damaged, abnormal amounts of albumin leak into the urine.'
 'For example, urine infection is generally diagnosed based on results of urinalysis. However, urine culture is often ordered as a follow-up test to identify the bacteria that may be causing the infection. Other examples include kidney stones, inflammation or the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).'
 'Overall, the sensitivity of the urine dipstick test for nitrites in testing for a UTI has been found to be low (45-60% in most situations) with higher levels of specificity (85-98%). The test for nitrites has its highest accuracy in specific populations such as pregnant women, urology patients and elderly people.'
 'A urine test should be expected during your first prenatal exam and then at least periodically in future prenatal visits. It would be normal for your healthcare provider to monitor your urine during each visit.'
 'Urinalysis is commonly used to diagnose a urinary tract or kidney infection, to evaluate causes of kidney failure, to screen for progression of some chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure (hypertension). It also may be used in combination with other tests to diagnose some diseases.'
 ""A urinalysis is simply an analysis of the urine. It is a very common test that can be performed in many healthcare settings including doctors' offices, urgent care facilities, laboratories, and hospitals. It is performed by collecting a urine sample from the patient in a specimen cup. Usually only small amounts (30-60 ml's) may be required for urinalysis testing.""

 'Adding weights to your squat routine engages the muscles of the upper body, essentially giving you a full body workout in one exercise. You can accomplish this with the use of a barbell, dumbbells or a weighted vest. When adding weights to your routine, start with lighter ones and build as your strength increases.'
 'Muscle burns fat. More muscle burns more fat. Being efficient at packing on muscle mass, the squat is a highly effective way to burn more fat. The more muscle you have on your frame, the more calories you will burn during training and at rest. If you want to get lean, stick to the big compound lifts namely the squat. 3. Squats are functional. Yes, the old school squat has finally been mentioned in the same breath as the uber-trendy term functionality.'
 'Squat exercises are great for a total lower body workout. They effectively work most of the major muscle groups of the butt, hips and thighs. Squats are also a versatile exercise.'
 '1 This will be your starting position. 2  Begin the movement by flexing your knees and hips, sitting back with your hips. 3  Continue down to full depth if you are able,and quickly reverse the motion until you return to the starting position. 4  As you squat, keep your head and chest up and push your knees out.'

 ""It's especially important to maintain proper form when using weights. Keep your knees aligned with your feet and don't squat beyond the point where your thighs are parallel to the floor. Squat exercises are a motion that your body uses often in real life.""
 'Squats are one of the best functional exercises out there, as humans have been squatting since the hunter-gatherer days. When you perform squats, you build muscle and help your muscles work more efficiently, as well as promote mobility and balance. All of these benefits translate into your body moving more efficiently in the real world too. 1  Burn More Fat.'
 'Main Muscle: Quadriceps. 1  Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. 2  Begin the movement by flexing your knees and hips, sitting back with your hips. 3  Continue down to full depth if you are able,and quickly reverse the motion until you return to the starting position.'
 'Squat exercises thoroughly engage the quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles, which helps to tone and strengthen the legs. Slowing the motion down makes the workout that much more intense. Doing squats gives the glutes a powerful workout, helping to tighten and lift the butt. To increase this effect, give your glutes an extra squeeze when returning to a standing position. Squats engage the core muscles of the body.']","According to the provided context, squats help your body in several ways:

1. Builds muscle: Squats help build muscle in your entire body, including your legs, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.
2. Creates an anabolic environment: Squats promote an anabolic environment, which helps with body-wide muscle building.

 ""SORT BY COLUMN HEAD (Arrow indicates current selection). With this chart, you can easily see a model's exterior dimensions, turning circle, weight, and cargo capacity. To sort models by a specification, click on the top of that column.""
 'The standard Prius also gets 50 mpg combined, though its city and highway numbers are 51 mpg and 48 mpg, respectively. Finally, the larger Prius v returns 44 mpg city/40 mpg hwy for a total of 42 mpg combined.'
 'With respect to the third generation Prius, it will not utilize a new lithium-ion battery pack as reported earlier by various sources. It will instead use a new nickel metal hydride battery pack that’s very much like the one found in the current car.'
 'The three Prius models share two engines: one for the Prius c and another for the Prius and Prius v. The Prius c, of course, uses the smallest powertrain: a 1.5-liter hybrid 4-cylinder that makes a combined 99 horsepower.'
 'The 2016 Volt has 90 cubic feet passenger volume, 19 cubic feet in the hatchback – it’s designed like a sedan, but is a hatch. The 2016 Prius specs were not released but it’s 2.4 inches longer, 0.6 inches wider and 0.8 inches lower than the 2015 which had 94 cubic feet passenger space, and 22 cubic feet volume. Interior room is believed better, and in real life, more stuff will pack into the Prius, and it’s roomier for people in back.'
 'The Prius Wagon is expected to debut in either 2010 or 2011. That’s a year or two after the next generation Prius comes out in 2009, which itself promises to be roomier, more powerful, and offer better fuel economy then the existing car.'
 'The difference between the interior of a Prius and a Prius v largely relates to size. The Prius v offers more cargo room: 34.9 cu ft, compared to just 21.6 cu ft in the standard Prius (the Prius c checks in at 17.1 cu ft).'
 'The Prius is not subsidized at all, and the Volt can qualify for $10,000 and more depending on state plus $7,500 federal credit. Some states offer zero. As for resale value, that may be a different matter. Leasing will change that concern as well, but the Prius appears to hold a higher percentage of its value.'

Tickets are on sale on our website at http://sdyoutopia.com/. Organized by: San Diego Collaborative Arts Project.'
 'Burning Man is a veritable magnet for misconceptions, so this is a great question. I think the biggest is to brand Burning Man as nothing more than a giant party rife with intoxicants, nudity, and bald hedonism. While it would be dishonest to claim that those elements are not present, they are neither as widespread nor as central to the event as many might assume.'

According to the text, board minutes should include basic information such as the date and time of the meeting, whether it's a special or regular meeting, and whether notice was given or a waiver of notice signed by all directors.

As for the appropriate time to send minutes, it's not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, considering the context of board meetings, it's likely that the minutes should be sent after the meeting has taken place, and possibly after any necessary actions or decisions have been taken.

In general, it's a good idea to send minutes in a timely manner, but not so quickly that it feels perfunctory or rushed. A good rule of thumb might be to send minutes within a few days or a week after the meeting, allowing time for any necessary follow-up or discussion.

 'Green Thumb Tip. Ficus elastica will grow to 40 ft (12 m) in its native habitat, but will stay much shorter when grown indoors in a container. Rubber plant will also bear fruit when it is 30 years old -- outdoors, not in.'
 'Watch out for sooty mold that can grow on leaves. You can remove it by simply wiping off the affected leaves with mild soapy water. Also check for signs of scale insects and mealybugs that may infest rubber plant. Care should be taken to treat any problems as soon as you notice them.'
 'The Rubber Plant will be quite happy to grow in a broad range of temperatures between 10°C / 50°F to 29°C / 85°F. If you go hotter, the leaves will lose some of their turgid appearance. You can go as low as 4.5°C / 40°F in Winter if you have to, but your watering must be spot on.'
 'You should not let a Rubber Plant sit in water, so after 30 minutes if there is still water remaining in the drip tray, pour it away. In Winter scale back to keeping the soil just moist.'

Just like many other plants in the Moraceae family, this one doesn't like to be moved around.""
 ""Speed of Growth. Growth of your Rubber Tree Plant can probably be described as moderately fast. Many owners Summer their plants outdoors which they feel encourages a rapid surge of new leaves. Don't over do the sun exposure though and watch out for wet Summers.""

Many former slaves described their mothers cooking meals in the fireplace and sewing or quilting late into the night.']","According to the context, slavery can be broadly described as the ownership, buying, and selling of human beings for the purpose of forced and unpaid labor."

Azimuth = atan2(sin(Δlon) * cos(φ2), cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(Δlon) * cos(φ2))

where:

* φ1 and φ2 are the latitudes of the two points
* Δlon is the difference in longitude between the two points
* atan2 is the arctangent function with two arguments

This formula calculates the azimuth in radians, so you may need to convert it to degrees if you want to express it in a more familiar unit.

Alternatively, you can use the Haversine formula to calculate the azimuth:

Azimuth = atan2(sin(Δlon) * cos(φ2), cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(Δlon) * cos(φ2))

where:

* φ1 and φ2 are the latitudes of the two points
* Δlon is the difference in longitude between the two points
* atan2 is the arctangent function with two arguments

This formula calculates the azimuth in radians, so you may need to convert it to degrees if you want to express it in a more familiar unit.

It's also worth noting that the azimuth is measured clockwise from north, so if you want to convert it to a more familiar unit like degrees east of north, you'll need to add 90 degrees to the result.
