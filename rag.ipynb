The workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the topics of designing large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences beyond playful interaction, understanding how different interaction models shape peopleâ€™s experience in urban spaces, and evaluating their impact. The ultimate goal is to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area.\n",

However, it's important to note that secured credit cards usually have higher fees and costs compared to mainstream credit cards. Also, while using a secured credit card responsibly can help improve your credit score, cash advances on secured credit cards may not help improve your credit score as they are not reported to credit bureaus. Prepaid debit cards, on the other hand, do not help improve credit scores.\n",
